Welcome to the brand new version of The Web Developer Bootcamp, Udemy's most popular web development course.&nbsp; This course was just completely overhauled to prepare students for the 2023 job market, with over 60 hours of brand new content. This is the <strong>only course you need to learn web development. </strong>There are a lot of options for online developer training, but this course is without a doubt the most comprehensive and effective on the market.&nbsp; Here's why:</p><ul><li><p><strong>This is the only Udemy course taught by a professional bootcamp instructor with a track record of success.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>92% of my in-person bootcamp students go on to get full-time developer jobs</strong>. Most of them are complete beginners when I start working with them.</p></li><li><p>The previous 2 bootcamp programs that I taught cost <strong>$14,000 and $21,000</strong>.&nbsp; This course is just as comprehensive but with brand new content for a fraction of the price.</p></li><li><p>Everything I cover is up-to-date and relevant to 2022's developer job market.<strong> This course does not cut any corners. I just spent 8 months redoing this behemoth of a course! </strong></p></li><li><p>We build 13+ projects, including a <strong>gigantic production application </strong>called YelpCamp. No other course walks you through the creation of such a substantial application.</p></li><li><p>The course is <strong>constantly updated</strong> with new content, projects, and modules.&nbsp; Think of it as a subscription to a never-ending supply of developer training.</p></li><li><p>You get to meet my cats and chickens! </p></li></ul><p>When you're learning to program you often have to sacrifice learning the exciting and current technologies in favor of the \"beginner friendly\" classes.&nbsp; With this course, you get the best of both worlds.&nbsp; This is a course designed for the complete beginner, yet it covers some of the most exciting and relevant topics in the industry.</p><p>Throughout the brand new version of the course we cover tons of tools and technologies including:</p><ul><li><p><strong>HTML5</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>CSS3</strong></p></li><li><p>Flexbox</p></li><li><p>Responsive Design</p></li><li><p><strong>JavaScript (all 2022 modern syntax, ES6, ES2018, etc.)</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Asynchronous JavaScript </strong>- Promises, async/await, etc.</p></li><li><p><strong>AJAX </strong>and single page apps</p></li><li><p>Bootstrap 4 and 5 </p></li><li><p><strong>ReactJS</strong></p></li><li><p>SemanticUI</p></li><li><p>Bulma CSS Framework</p></li><li><p><strong>DOM Manipulation</strong></p></li><li><p>Unix(Command Line) Commands</p></li><li><p><strong>NodeJS</strong></p></li><li><p>NPM</p></li><li><p><strong>ExpressJS</strong></p></li><li><p>Templating</p></li><li><p><strong>REST</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>SQL</strong>&nbsp;vs. <strong>NoSQL</strong> databases</p></li><li><p><strong>MongoDB</strong></p></li><li><p>Database Associations</p></li><li><p><strong>Schema Design</strong></p></li><li><p>Mongoose</p></li><li><p><strong>Authentication From Scratch</strong></p></li><li><p>Cookies &amp; Sessions</p></li><li><p>Authorization</p></li><li><p><strong>Common Security Issues - SQL&nbsp;Injection, XSS, etc.</strong></p></li><li><p>Developer Best Practices</p></li><li><p><strong>Deploying Apps</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Cloud Databases</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Image Upload </strong>and Storage</p></li><li><p><strong>Maps and Geocoding</strong></p></li></ul><p>This course is also unique in the way that it is structured and presented. Many online courses are just a long series of \"watch as I code\" videos.&nbsp; This course is different. I've incorporated everything I learned in my years of teaching to make this course not only more effective but more engaging. The course includes:<br></p><ul><li><p>Lectures</p></li><li><p>Code-Alongs</p></li><li><p>Projects</p></li><li><p>Exercises</p></li><li><p>Research Assignments</p></li><li><p>Slides</p></li><li><p>Downloads</p></li><li><p>Readings</p></li><li><p>Too many pictures of my dog Rusty</p></li></ul><p>If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact me.&nbsp; I got into this industry because I love working with people and helping students learn.&nbsp; Sign up today and see how fun, exciting, and rewarding web development can be!</p>",

            "description": "<p><strong><em>*Update 2024:&nbsp;ChatGPT for Data Science added*</em></strong></p><p><strong>The Problem</strong></p><p>Data scientist is one of the best suited professions to thrive this century. It is digital, programming-oriented, and analytical. Therefore, it comes as no surprise that the demand for data scientists has been surging in the job marketplace.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>However, supply has been very limited. It is difficult to acquire the skills necessary to be hired as a data scientist.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>And how can you do that? &nbsp; </p><p>Universities have been slow at creating specialized data science programs. (not to mention that the ones that exist are very expensive and time consuming)&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>Most online courses focus on a specific topic and it is difficult to understand how the skill they teach fit in the complete picture &nbsp; </p><p><strong>The Solution</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>Data science is a multidisciplinary field. It encompasses a wide range of topics.&nbsp; &nbsp; </p><ul><li><p>Understanding of the data science field and the type of analysis carried out &nbsp; </p></li><li><p>Mathematics &nbsp; </p></li><li><p>Statistics&nbsp; &nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Python&nbsp; &nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Applying advanced statistical techniques in Python&nbsp; &nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Data Visualization &nbsp; </p></li><li><p>Machine Learning &nbsp; </p></li><li><p>Deep Learning &nbsp; </p></li></ul><p>Each of these topics builds on the previous ones. And you risk getting lost along the way if you don’t acquire these skills in the right order. For example, one would struggle in the application of Machine Learning techniques before understanding the underlying Mathematics. Or, it can be overwhelming to study regression analysis in Python before knowing what a regression is.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>So, in an effort to create the most effective, time-efficient, and structured data science training available online, we created The Data Science Course 2024.</em></strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>We believe this is the first training program that solves the biggest challenge to entering the data science field <strong>– having all the necessary resources in one place.</strong> &nbsp; </p><p>Moreover, our focus is to teach topics that flow smoothly and complement each other. The course teaches you everything you need to know to become a data scientist at a fraction of the cost of traditional programs (not to mention the amount of time you will save).&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Skills</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;1.&nbsp;Intro to Data and Data Science</strong></p><p>Big data, business intelligence, business analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence. We know these buzzwords belong to the field of data science but what do they all mean?&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p><strong>Why learn it?</strong>\nAs a candidate data scientist, you must understand the ins and outs of each of these areas and recognise the appropriate approach to solving a problem. This ‘Intro to data and data science’ will give you a comprehensive look at all these buzzwords and where they fit in the realm of data science.\n&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>2. Mathematics</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Learning the tools is the first step to doing data science. You must first see the big picture to then examine the parts in detail.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>We take a detailed look specifically at calculus and linear algebra as they are the subfields data science relies on.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p><strong>Why learn it?</strong> &nbsp; </p><p>Calculus and linear algebra are essential for programming in data science. If you want to understand advanced machine learning algorithms, then you need these skills in your arsenal.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>3. Statistics</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>You need to think like a scientist before you can become a scientist. Statistics trains your mind to frame problems as hypotheses and gives you techniques to test these hypotheses, just like a scientist. &nbsp; </p><p><strong>Why learn it?</strong> &nbsp; </p><p>This course doesn’t just give you the tools you need but teaches you how to use them. Statistics trains you to think like a scientist.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>4. Python</strong></p><p>Python is a relatively new programming language and, unlike R, it is a general-purpose programming language. You can do anything with it! Web applications, computer games and data science are among many of its capabilities. That’s why, in a short space of time, it has managed to disrupt many disciplines. Extremely powerful libraries have been developed to enable data manipulation, transformation, and visualisation. Where Python really shines however, is when it deals with machine and deep learning.</p><p><strong>Why learn it?</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>When it comes to developing, implementing, and deploying machine learning models through powerful frameworks such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, etc, Python is a must have programming language. &nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>5. Tableau</strong></p><p>Data scientists don’t just need to deal with data and solve data driven problems. They also need to convince company executives of the right decisions to make. These executives may not be well versed in data science, so the data scientist must but be able to present and visualise the data’s story in a way they will understand. That’s where Tableau comes in – and we will help you become an expert story teller using the leading visualisation software in business intelligence and data science.</p><p><strong>Why learn it?</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>A data scientist relies on business intelligence tools like Tableau to communicate complex results to non-technical decision makers. &nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>6. Advanced Statistics</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Regressions, clustering, and factor analysis are all disciplines that were invented before machine learning. However, now these statistical methods are all performed through machine learning to provide predictions with unparalleled accuracy. This section will look at these techniques in detail. &nbsp; </p><p><strong>Why learn it?</strong> &nbsp; </p><p>Data science is all about predictive modelling and you can become an expert in these methods through this ‘advance statistics’ section. &nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>7. Machine Learning</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>The final part of the program and what every section has been leading up to is deep learning. Being able to employ machine and deep learning in their work is what often separates a data <em>scientist </em>from a data <em>analyst. </em>This section covers all common machine learning techniques and deep learning methods with TensorFlow. &nbsp; </p><p><strong>Why learn it?</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>Machine learning is everywhere. Companies like Facebook, Google, and Amazon have been using machines that can learn on their own for years. Now is the time for <em>you</em> to control the machines. &nbsp; </p><p><strong>**What you get**</strong></p><ul><li><p>A $1250 data science training program&nbsp; &nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Active Q&amp;A support &nbsp; </p></li><li><p>All the knowledge to get hired as a data scientist &nbsp; </p></li><li><p>A community of data science learners &nbsp; </p></li><li><p>A certificate of completion&nbsp; &nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Access to future updates &nbsp; </p></li><li><p>Solve real-life business cases that will get you the job&nbsp; &nbsp; </p></li></ul><p><strong>You will become a data scientist from scratch</strong>\n\n&nbsp; We are happy to offer an unconditional 30-day money back in full guarantee.

I will wait here...</p><p>...</p><p>Amazing, right? What if you knew exactly how to design and build a website like that, completely from scratch? How amazing would that be?</p><p>Well, I'm here to teach you<strong> HTML, CSS, and web design, all by building the stunning website that you just saw</strong>, step-by-step.</p><p>So, after finishing this course, you will know exactly how to build a beautiful, professional, and ready-to-launch website just like Omnifood, by following a 7-step process. And it will even look great on any computer, tablet, and smartphone.</p><p>But what if you want to build a completely different website? Well, no problem! I designed the course curriculum with exactly this goal: to <strong>enable you to design and build any website that you can think of, not just copy the course project</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>So, in order to become a confident and independent developer, capable of building your own websites in the future, you will learn:</strong></p><ul><li><p>The fundamentals of modern and semantic HTML, CSS, and building layouts in a small separate project, which will prepare you for the main course project (<em>www.omnifood.dev</em>). This includes modern flexbox and CSS Grid!</p></li><li><p>How to design beautiful websites, by learning a web design framework I created just for this course. It consists of easy-to-use guidelines for design aspects like typography, colors, images, spacing, and more (this is like a small standalone course!).</p></li><li><p>How to use well-established website components and layout patterns in order to come up with professional-looking designs</p></li><li><p>How to make any website work on any mobile device, no matter the design and layout (responsive design)</p></li><li><p>How to use the 7 steps of building a professional website in practice: planning, sketching, designing, building, testing, optimizing, and launching</p></li><li><p>How to find and use free design assets such as images, fonts, and icons</p></li><li><p>Important developer skills such as reading documentation, fixing code errors on your own, and using professional web development tools</p></li></ul><p><strong>Does this sound like fun? Then join me and 200,000+ other developers and start building websites today!</strong></p><p><em>Or are you not sold yet and need to know more? No problem, just keep reading...</em></p><p><br></p><p><strong>[01] Why should you learn HTML and CSS in the first place?</strong></p><p>Building websites allows you to do <strong>fun and creative work, from anywhere in the world, and it even pays well</strong>. Web development is one of the <strong>most future-proof and highest-paying industries</strong> in the world. And HTML and CSS is the entry point to this world!</p><p>But you already know all this, that's why you want to learn HTML and CSS too. Well, you came to the right place!</p><p>This is the best and most complete course for starting your web development journey that you will find on Udemy. It's an <strong>all-in-one package</strong> that takes you from knowing nothing about HTML and CSS, to building beautiful websites using tools and technologies that professional web developers use every single day.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>[02] Why is this course so unique and popular?</strong></p><p><strong><em>Reason #1: The course is completely project-based</em></strong></p><p>Simple demos are boring, and therefore you're gonna learn everything by <strong>building actual projects</strong>! In the final project (<em>www.omnifood.dev</em>), together we hand-code a beautiful and responsive landing page for a <strong>fictional company</strong> that I made up just for the course.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Reason #2: You will not just learn how to code</em></strong></p><p>Coding is great, but it's not everything! That's why we will go through the entire <strong>7-step process</strong> of building and launching our website project.</p><p>So the huge Omnifood project will teach you <strong>real-world skills to build real-world HTML and CSS websites</strong>: how to plan projects and page layouts, how to implement designs using HTML and CSS techniques, how to write clean and organized code, how to optimize websites for good speed performance, and many more.</p><p>On top of that, this course has a <strong>huge focus on beautiful design</strong>. In fact, this is the only course on the market that focuses on both coding and designing, together.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Reason #3: I'm the right teacher for you</em></strong></p><p>With the right guidance and a well-structured curriculum, building websites can be <strong>quite easy and fun to learn</strong>. With a bunch of random tutorials and YouTube videos? Not so much. And that's where I come in.</p><p>My name is Jonas, I'm an experienced web developer and designer, and one of Udemy's top instructors. I have been teaching this bestselling course since 2015 to over 200,000 developers, always listening to feedback and understanding exactly how students actually learn.</p><p>Using that feedback, I recently rebuilt this course from scratch and <strong>designed the ideal course curriculum</strong> for every type of student. It's a <strong>unique blend</strong> of projects, deep explanations, theory lectures, and challenges. I'm sure you're gonna love it!</p><p><br></p><p><strong>[03] Why is this course so long?</strong></p><p><strong>Reason #1:</strong> I take time to <strong>explain every single concept</strong> that I teach, so that you actually learn, and not just copy code from the screen (<strong>this is a course</strong>, not a tutorial)</p><p><strong>Reason #2:</strong> I go into topics that other HTML and CSS courses shy away from: professional web design, component and layout patterns, some CSS theory, website planning in theory and practice, and developer skills. I believe you need all of this to be successful!</p><p><strong>Reason #3:</strong> There is a lot of repetition, so that you actually <strong>assimilate and practice</strong> what you learn. Practice is the single most important ingredient to learning, and therefore I provide plenty of opportunities for you to sharpen your skills</p><p><br></p><p><strong>[04] Here is what's also included in the package:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Up-to-date HD-quality videos, that are easy to search and reference (great for Udemy Business students)</p></li><li><p>Professional English captions (not the&nbsp;auto-generated ones)</p></li><li><p>Downloadable design assets + starter code and final code for each section</p></li><li><p>Downloadable slides for 20+ theory videos (not boring, I promise!)</p></li><li><p>Access to countless free design and development resources that I curated over many years</p></li><li><p>Free support in the course Q&amp;A</p></li><li><p>10+ coding challenges to practice your new skills (solutions included)</p></li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>[05] This course is for you if...</strong></p><ul><li><p>... you are a complete beginner with no idea of how to build a website.</p></li><li><p>... you already know a bit of HTML and CSS from some tutorials or videos, but struggle to put together a good-looking, complete website.</p></li><li><p>... you are a designer and want to expand your skills into HTML and CSS, because all your designer friends are learning how to code (they are smart!).</p></li></ul><p>Basically, if you are an HTML and CSS master, and build the most beautiful websites in the world, then DON'T take the course. Everyone else: you should take the course, today.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>So, does all of this sound great? Then join me and 200,000+ other developers and start your web development journey today!</em></strong></p>",

            "description": "<p>This course started as a <strong>runaway&nbsp;success on Kickstarter</strong> and has gone on to become the most popular and most watched&nbsp;Unity game development course on Udemy<strong>. </strong>The course has full&nbsp;<strong>English closed-captions throughout</strong>.</p><p>Learn how to create video games using Unity, the world-leading&nbsp;free-to-use game development tool. <strong>We start super simple </strong>so you need no prior experience of&nbsp;Unity or&nbsp;coding! With our online tutorials, you'll be amazed what you can achieve right from the first moment you start the course.&nbsp; </p><p>Benefit from our <strong>world-class support </strong>from both other students, and the GameDevtv team who are regularly engaged in the&nbsp;forums and Q&amp;A section. Go on to build several games including:</p><ul><li><p>Snow Boarder: A simple <strong>Side-Scrolling jumping game </strong>using Unity's sprite shape tool</p></li><li><p>Laser Defender:&nbsp;A <strong>Top-Down Space Shooter </strong>with enemies to shoot and dodge;</p></li><li><p>TileVania: A fast-paced classic <strong>Side-Scrolling&nbsp;Platformer </strong>using Unity's Tilemap tool;</p></li><li><p>Quiz Master: A <strong>Quiz Game </strong>that focuses on learning how to set up user interface in Unity.</p></li></ul><p>Prefer to start with 3D&nbsp;games? Check-out our sister course, the Complete C# Unity Developer 3D. Already have some Unity knowledge, and want something more challenging? Check-out our epic RPG Core Combat Creator. More interested in creating 3D models from scratch? Start with our <em>Complete Blender Creator</em> course. <strong>Our green leaf logo is a symbol of passion and quality.</strong></p><p>You will have access to a course forum where you can discuss topics on a course-wide basis, or down to the individual video. Get plugged into our communities of amazing developers on Facebook (nearly 20k), in our own TA-curated Community (17k views/day), and our student chat group (10k live at any one time). Check out our reviews to see how people love this feature.&nbsp; </p><p>The course is <strong>project-based</strong> as we believe this is the best way to learn Unity and C#. You will not just be learning dry programming concepts, but applying them immediately to real indie games as you go. All the project files will be included, as well as additional references and resources - you'll never get stuck. There are talking-head videos, powerful diagrams, quality screencasts and more.&nbsp; </p><p>Oh, and it's just <strong>bigger and better </strong>than other Unity courses you will find online. See the course&nbsp;length and the reviews.&nbsp; </p><p> For each demo game you build you will follow this process...&nbsp; </p><ul><li><p>Be challenged to build the entire game yourself.</p></li><li><p>Be shown step-by step how to build it.</p></li><li><p>Be challenged to apply, and re-apply your knowledge regularly.</p></li></ul><p>You will get full <strong>lifetime access</strong> for a single one-off fee. The creators are qualified and experienced coders and avid gamers, so are able to explain complex concepts clearly, as well as entertain along the way.&nbsp;</p><p>You will <strong>learn C#, </strong>and in turn build a solid foundation for Object Oriented Programming. By the end of the course you'll be very confident in the basics of coding and game development, and hungry to learn more.&nbsp; </p><p><strong>What this course DOESN'T cover...</strong>&nbsp; </p><p>Whereas this course is already huge, we can't possibly cover everything in that time. Here are some things we will not be covering...&nbsp; </p><ul><li><p>Performance optimization.</p></li><li><p>Editor plugins or modifications.</p></li><li><p>Physics engine modification</p></li></ul><p>Anyone who wants to learn to create games: <strong>Unity is a fantastic platform which enables you to make production-quality games.</strong> Furthermore these games can be created for Windows, MacOS, iOS, Android and Web from a single source!</p><p>If you're a complete beginner, we'll teach you all the coding and game design principles you'll need. If you're an artist, we'll teach you to bring your assets to life. If you're a coder, we'll teach you game design principles.&nbsp; </p><p><strong>Dive in and learn Unity now, you won't be disappointed!</strong></p>",

And this course is designed to give you those core skills, fast.</p><p>This course is aimed at complete beginners who have never programmed before, as well as existing programmers who want to increase their career options by learning Python.</p><p>The fact is, Python is one of the most popular programming languages in the world – Huge companies like Google use it in mission critical applications like Google Search.</p><p>And Python is the number one language choice for machine learning, data science and artificial intelligence. To get those high paying jobs you need an expert knowledge of Python, and that’s what you will get from this course.</p><p>By the end of the course you’ll be able to apply in confidence for Python programming jobs. And yes, this applies even if you have never programmed before. With the right skills which you will learn in this course, you can become employable and valuable in the eyes of future employers.</p><p>Here’s what a few students have told us about the course after going through it.</p><p>“I had very limited programming experience before I started this course, so I have really learned a lot from the first few sections. It has taken me from essentially zero programming skill to a level where I'm comfortable using Python to analyze data for my lab reports, and I'm not even halfway done the course yet. There are other courses out there which focus on data analysis, but those courses are usually targeted at people who already know how to program which is why I chose this course instead. “ – Christian DiMaria<br> <br>“I have been puttering through your Python course . In that time, though, and without finishing it yet I've been able to automate quite a bit at my work. I work in a school system and unifying data from our various student information systems can be incredibly frustrating, time consuming, and at times challenging. Using your course, I've learned enough to write applications that turn massive text files into dictionaries that get \"stitched\" together like a database and output to properly formatted CSV files and then uploaded via SFTP to various systems for secure processing. Our teachers, students, and the tech department have greatly benefitted from this automation. I just wanted to drop you a note thanking you for helping me learn this skill.” – Keith Medlin<br> <br>“This course was great. Within 3 weeks I was able to write my own database related applications.” – Theo Coenen<br> <br>And there are many more students who love the course – check out all the reviews for yourself.</p><p><strong>Will this course give you core python skills?</strong></p><p>Yes it will.  There are a range of exciting opportunities for Python developers. All of them require a solid understanding of Python, and that’s what you will learn in this course.</p><p><strong>Will the course teach me data science, machine learning and artificial intelligence?</strong></p><p>No, it won’t do that – All of these topics are branches of Python programming.  And all of them require a solid understanding of the Python language.</p><p>Nearly all courses on these topics assume that you understand Python, and without it you will quickly become lost and confused.</p><p>This course will give you that core, solid understanding of the Python programming language.</p><p>By the end of the course you will be ready to apply for Python programming positions as well as move on to specific areas of Python, as listed above. </p><p><strong>Why should you take this course?</strong></p><p>There are a lot of Python courses on Udemy – Your instructors, Tim and Jean-Paul are pretty unique in that between them they have around 70 years of professional programming experience.  That’s more than a lifetime of skills you get to learn Python from.</p><p>You can enrol in the course safe in the knowledge that they are not just teachers, but professional programmers with real commercial programming experience, having worked with big companies like IBM, Mitsubishi, Fujitsu and Saab in the past.</p><p>As such you will not only be learning Python, but you will be learning industry best practices for Python programming that real employers demand.  </p><p>And if that’s not enough take a read of some of the many reviews from happy students – there are around 100,000 students who have left around 19,000 reviews.</p><p>This is one of the most popular courses on Python programming on Udemy.</p><p><strong>Here’s just some of what you’ll learn</strong></p><p>(It’s okay if you don’t understand all this yet, you will in the course)</p><p>·       All the essential Python keywords, operators, statements, and expressions needed to fully understand exactly what you’re coding and why - making programming easy to grasp and less frustrating</p><p>·       You will learn the answers to questions like What is the Python For Loop, what is Python used for, how Python switch the traditional syntax of code, and more.</p><p>·       Complete chapters on object-oriented programming and many other aspects of Python, including tKInter (for building GUI Interfaces) and using databases with Python.</p><p>·       Although this is primarily a Python 3 course, a python developer will need to work with Python 2 projects from time to time – We’ll show the difference in both versions to make sure you understand how things work differently in each version.</p><p>·        How to develop powerful Python applications using one of the most powerful Integrated Development Environments on the market, IntelliJ IDEA! - Meaning you can code functional programs easier.  <strong>IntelliJ</strong> has both a <strong>FREE</strong> and PAID version, and you can use either in this course.  PyCharm will also work just fine.</p><p>(Don’t worry if you want to use another IDE. You’re free to use any IDE and still get the most out of this course).<br> <br><strong>Does the course get updated?</strong></p><p>It’s no secret how technology is advancing at a rapid rate. New, more powerful hardware and software are being released <em>every day</em>, meaning it’s crucial to stay on top with the latest knowledge.<br> <br> A lot of other courses on Udemy get released once, and never get updated.  Learning from an outdated course and/or an outdated version of Python can be counter productive and even worse it could teach you the wrong way to do things.</p><p>For example if you apply some parts of Python 2 to Python 3 code, you will get completely different results.</p><p>We cover differences like this in the course and also continually update the course as well.</p><p><strong><em>What if you have questions?</em></strong></p><p>As if this course wasn’t complete enough, we offer <strong>full support</strong>, answering any questions you have <strong>7 days a week</strong> (whereas many instructors answer just once per week, <em>or not at all</em>). </p><p>This means you’ll never find yourself stuck on one lesson for days on end. With our hand-holding guidance, you’ll progress smoothly through this course without any major roadblocks. </p><p>That’s just one reason why Tim was voted <strong>top 10 in the  Udemy instructor awards</strong> (out of a whopping 18,000 instructors), and quickly became a top-rated, bestselling instructor on the Udemy site.  </p><p><em>Student Quote: “</em>Tim and JP are excellent teachers and are constantly answering questions and surveying students on new topics they will like to learn. This isn't a Python course it’s THE Python course you need.” – Sean Burger</p><p><strong><em>There’s no risk either!</em></strong></p><p>This course comes with a <strong>full 30 day money-back guarantee</strong>. Meaning if you are not completely satisfied with the course or your progress, simply let Tim or J-P know and they will refund you 100%, every last penny no questions asked.</p><p>You either end up with Python skills, go on to develop great programs and potentially make an awesome career for yourself, or you try the course and simply get all your money back if you don’t like it… </p><p><strong>You literally can’t lose.</strong> </p><p><strong>Ready to get started, developer?</strong></p><p><strong>Enrol now </strong>using the “Add to Cart” button on the right, and get started on your way to creative, advanced Python brilliance. Or, take this course for a free spin using the preview feature, so you know you’re 100% certain this course is for you. </p><p><strong>See you on the inside <em>(hurry, your Python class is waiting!)</em></strong></p>",

She does a wonderful job of encouraging you to learn swift the right way. I want to encourage everyone thinking about taking this class to get it, as it is the </em><strong><em>BEST Swift programming class</em></strong><em> I've seen on anywhere and I've tried more than a few of them. If you are looking for an excellent swift programming course, stop there here because you have found it. You will learn Swift from the very beginning of programming all the way through making your own apps that you can upload to the App store.\" - Ian Hopjins</em></p><p><em>\"SO GOOD!!! </em><strong><em>Retention rate is incredible</em></strong><em> because Angela does a great job in explaining and teaching every aspect of what we are doing. Most of the other instructors on Udemy put code on the screen and pretend nothing happened. This course is amazing! 5/5\"</em> - Muhammad Ibrahim</p><p><em>\"Angela is a </em><strong><em>spectacular</em></strong><em> teacher!\"</em> - Marco Zanirato</p><p><em>\"This course was terrific. Only after taking a few more courses from others that I</em><strong><em> realized how good this course</em></strong><em> was. This course taught me more than I was expecting, it provided great instructions and a lot of hands-on tasks to drill-in the concept.\" - Marc</em></p><p><em>\"Best use of your money! I was a complete beginner but </em><strong><em>Angela made me a pro</em></strong><em> in weeks.\"</em> - Burak Tunçbilek</p><p><em>\"IT IS #1!!!!!!!!! Absolutely Amazing. The best iOS course i have ever taken. Angela explains everything the way it needs to be explained, so everything is easily understood. The concept of </em><strong><em>this course is built to make you learn, not just watch</em></strong><em> and repeat. Angela is highly educated and it is very much noticeable during the entire course. Again, it is fantastic. Thank you. Please create more courses!!!!!\"</em> - Eduard Khachian</p><p><strong>Are you trying to choose between all the different iOS courses on Udemy? Take a look at what students on my course had to say about this:</strong></p><p><em>I have revamped my expectation for what a</em><strong><em> 5 star course </em></strong><em>should be for Udemy. Angela, you're awesome! I already rated the course as 5 stars early on (at about 20% completion), but after completing roughly 70% of the course, I can say this is my favourite Udemy course as of today. Brilliant course Angela!</em> - Alberto L</p><p><em>\"I took a lot of courses on Udemy and elsewhere and non of them were as clear and perfectly paced as this one! Angelas approach is really awesome, </em><strong><em>deep and clear</em></strong><em>.\" - Žan Fras</em></p><p><em>\"I have taken several iOS courses, so far this course had the </em><strong><em>best explanation </em></strong><em>on swift and xcode documentation. The lecturer is kinda humorous sometimes which make this course even more enjoyable.\" - Bryan Pukanda</em></p><p><em>\"I have taken lots of courses on udemy and elsewhere for self learning and i can tell you with all the honesty this is one course which </em><strong><em>i did not want it to end</em></strong><em>. It is like one of those movies that you wish keeps going. Whatever concepts are covered were covered very beautifully and made learning quite simple. I got so many answers to Why? in this course like how closures work and why they work that way... why delegates work that way. Thank you so much for this course.\" - Arun Lakhera</em></p><p><em>\"I compare this to another top iOS class on Udemy, but I think that this one beats it. The reason? Angela doesn't show you a plethora of material and then say that we will discuss this later, or say \"just do this. You will see why later.\" She goes into the </em><strong><em>reason for doing something</em></strong><em> before doing it.\"</em> - Clyde Addison</p><p><strong>Do you have some experience developing iOS apps and wonder if this course is for you? Take a look at what students on my course had to say about this:</strong></p><p><em>\"This is the best-organized course for starting Swift that I've seen. The course is excellent for teaching Swift programming including vital information using Xcode, Github, Cocoapods, Stack Overflow, Alamofire, Firebase, REST APIs and all the services commonly used by app developers. They show all the ways of using Xcode and other services that took me months to learn willy nilly. </em><strong><em>Wish I had this course a year ago</em></strong><em> but even with a year of Swift experience I still found a lot of great information and helpful tips. Love all the extras the course provides especially the assets(graphics, sound files, etc) for practice projects as I'm always taking too much time to find some assets to play with. This course understands how to teach programmers by giving them the toolsets and abilities they need to build apps. The course teaches the foundation of the language as well as skills to build your knowledge and improve your troubleshooting skills. Angela is a wonderful speaker and should do the voiceovers on everyone's instructional videos, seriously. :)\" - Marcy Vernon</em></p><p><em>\"Def. an amazing and awesome class for learning iOS programming. I've been coding for years and taken many programming related classes on Udemy and this is def. one of the best. The instructor walks you through all the in's and out's of developing apps for the iOS platform. </em><strong><em>Top Shelf A++ class</em></strong><em>.\"</em> - Mirko Cukich</p><p><strong>REMEMBER… I'm so confident that you'll love this course that we're offering a FULL money back guarantee for 30 days!

The course also <strong>includes new content on Spring Boot 3, Spring Data JPA, Spring Data REST and Thymeleaf</strong>.</p><p>Beware of other Udemy Spring/Hibernate courses. Most of them are outdated and use old versions of Spring and Hibernate. Don’t waste your time or money on learning outdated technology.</p><p>Also, I create all of the <strong>code from scratch in this course</strong>. Beware of other courses, those instructors simply copy/paste from their github repo or they use pre-written code. Their approach is not ideal for real-time learning.</p><p>Take <strong>my course</strong> where I show you how to <strong>create all of the code from scratch</strong>. You can<strong> type the code along with me in the videos</strong>, which is the<strong> best way to learn</strong>.</p><p>I am a <strong>very responsive instructor</strong> and I am available to <strong>answer your questions </strong>and help you work through any problems.</p><p>Finally, all source code is provided with the course along with setup instructions.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Student Reviews Prove This Course's Worth</strong></p><p>Those who have reviewed the course have pointed out that <strong>the instruction is clear and easy to follow</strong>, as well as thorough and highly informative.</p><p>Many students had also taken other Spring Boot and Hibernate courses in the past, only to find that <strong>this Spring Boot and Hibernate course was their favorite</strong>. They enjoyed the <strong>structure of the content</strong> and <strong>the high quality audio/video</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Sample of the Student Reviews:</strong></p><p><em>Best Spring Boot course by far </em><strong><em>across all learning platforms</em></strong><em> for me. Best course structure and instructor always demonstrates in depth knowledge by covering the necessary basics. Really really incredible good presentation and structure, a lot of other instructors can learn a lot from you Chad. - Muzi P.</em></p><p><br></p><p><em>I worked in some company, so I can say that this course is 100% industry oriented. The best course for learning Spring Framework. Getting replies within 24 hours.</em> - Premang</p><p><br></p><p><em>Chad Darby has done a </em><strong><em>superb job organizing this course</em></strong><em>, and has </em><strong><em>made Spring Framework, MVC, AOP, Hibernate, Security easy to learn and use</em></strong><em>. I have a bs and ms in CS, have been developing software for 25 years, and have taken many courses over the years at the different companies I've been at and Chad is easily the best instructor I've had. </em>- Dave Zeltserman</p><p><br></p><p><em>This is </em><strong><em>the best tutorial I've seen so far for Spring/Hibernate</em></strong><em>, each step is well explained and the tutorial videos are made to a high standard. I highly recommend this course!</em> - Rob</p><p><br></p><p><em>Hats off to you Chad, </em><strong><em>the best Spring fundamentals course I have done on Udemy</em></strong><em> thus far.

In the past year, I’ve created over 300 video tutorials (public and private). My YouTube channel has <strong>over 6.8 million views</strong> and <strong>40k</strong> subscribers. So I understand what works and what doesn’t work for creating video tutorials.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>No Risk – Udemy Refund</strong></p><p>Finally, <strong>there is no risk</strong>. You can preview 25% of the course for free. Once you purchase the course, if for some reason you are not happy with the course, <strong>Udemy offers a 30-day refund (based on Udemy's Refund Policy)</strong>.</p><p>So you have nothing to lose, <strong>sign up for this course and learn how to build Spring Boot and Hibernate Real-Time Projects from scratch!</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Target Audience</strong></p><ul><li><p>Java Developers with basic Java experience</p></li></ul>",

You start a new course, and the instructor has you installing a bunch of libraries before you even know what Node is or how it works. You eventually get stuck and reach out to the instructor, but you get no reply. You then close the course and never open it again.</p><p>Sound familiar?</p><p><strong>I created this course to be what I wanted when I was learning Node.</strong></p><p>The Complete Node.js Developer Course covers the fundamentals of Node before diving deep into great tools like Express, Mongoose, and MongoDB.</p><p>The entire course is based around a single goal: Turning you into a professional Node developer capable of developing, testing, and deploying real-world production applications.</p><p><strong>The best way to learn Node is by building Node apps.</strong></p><p>From the very start you’ll be programming every project and working through challenges that I’ve designed to reinforce what you’ve learned. This will give you the hands-on experience necessary to be able to create and launch your own project once you’re done.</p><p>You’ll be building four projects:</p><p>1. A note-taking app to get your feet wet</p><p>2. A weather application that interacts with the MapBox and Dark Sky APIs</p><p>3. A task manager REST API complete with user accounts and authentication</p><p>4. A real-time chat app with a client-side companion</p><p>By the end, you’ll be able to take what you’ve learned and launch your own Node application.</p><p><strong>When learning, learn the latest.</strong></p><p>I work to keep this course full of the most up-to-date Node material out there.

If you go to GitHub you will see that there are a huge number of active C++ repositories and C++ is also extremely active on stack overflow.</p><p>There are many, many leading software titles written entirely or partly in C++.&nbsp;These include the Windows, Linux, and Mac OSX operating systems!</p><p>Many of the Adobe products such as Photoshop and Illustrator, &nbsp;the MySQL and MongoDB database engines, and many many more are written in C++.</p><p>Leading tech companies use C++ for many of their products and internal research and development. These include Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, PayPal, Google, Facebook, Oracle, and many more.</p><p><strong>Can you see how learning C++ will open up more career opportunities for you?</strong></p><p>If more professional companies are using C++, it stands to reason that there is going to be more of a demand for C++ programmers.</p><p>But the main reason programmers should probably learn C++ &nbsp;is because it is so powerful!</p><p>What do I mean by powerful?</p><p><strong>C++ is&nbsp;super fast and&nbsp;is a general-purpose programming language that supports both procedure and object-oriented programming making it very flexible.</strong></p><p>It can scale easily. And it can be portable as well.</p><p>C++ can do many things that other languages just can't.</p><p>That's why nearly every major language has a way to interface with code written in C++.</p><p>Since C++ has influenced so many languages, if you know C++ you'll likely see elements from C++ in new languages you learn.</p><p><strong>How can a beginner learn C++?</strong><br><br>Find&nbsp;a good course, taught by an instructor with many years of experience in C++ is critical, as is the need for the instructor to have the necessary skills to be able to teach you the language.</p><p>Frank Mitropolous, the instructor in this course has been using C++ for over 2 decades and has taught students in both university courses and industry training courses. &nbsp;He even worked on a C++ compiler development project while he was in the industry.</p><p>So not&nbsp;only will you be learning C++ from an expert C++ programmer, but you'll also be taught by an instructor who has successfully taught&nbsp;at university level for many years.</p><p>As a result, you can take this course with confidence, knowing that you will learn C++ the right way, and in the shortest possible timeframe.</p><p><strong>Which version of C++ should I learn?</strong></p><p>C++ has had many version releases and updates over the years. &nbsp;It's a sad fact that most C++ courses do not teach Modern C++, but focus on old, obsolete versions of C++.</p><p>Frank teaches you Modern C++ (specifically C++ 14 and C++17). &nbsp;</p><p>Learn C++ the right way, with Modern C++, as taught by Frank in this course.</p><p><strong>What about C++20? Don't I need to learn about that as well?</strong></p><p>This course currently covers C++14 and C++17 but is still valid if you ultimately want to learn C++20.&nbsp; </p><p>C++20 is new and the reality is that C++20 compilers and tools are not yet ready for prime time and the industry is using mainly C++14.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;So it's not really of any benefit for you to learn C++20 right now when the industry is not using it.&nbsp;</p><p>It's going to take many, many years for the industry to migrate to C++20 and that means jobs for C++20 are not going to be around for quite some time.<br><br>What is available right now, are tons of jobs for Modern C++ developers, and you will obtain those skills in this course. <br><br>It's our sincere advice to focus on learning Modern C++ and not get too hung up on the latest and greatest versions of C++.<br><br>And even if you really do want to learn C++20,&nbsp; the new features in C++20 are mostly advanced features that require understanding the foundations of Modern C++.<br><br>If you don't learn the basics, you won't master any version of C++.</p><p>Learning the foundations of Modern C++ should be your priority, which you will learn in this course!</p><p><strong>Is C++ difficult to learn?</strong></p><p>With all the power and flexibility of C++ comes complexity.</p><p>There is no question that C++ is one of the most complex programming languages out there.</p><p>But with the right instructor and the right training, you really can&nbsp;get up to speed with C++ quickly,&nbsp;and that's what this course is all about.</p><p><strong>What will I learn in this course?</strong></p><p>The course assumes no previous experience with C++ (or even programming in general), and you will end up with the skills to create your own programs in C++.</p><p>Key topics covered include.</p><p>* Looping with while, do/while for, range-based for statements and recursion<br>* Performing calculations and displaying results<br>* Functions<br>* Pointers<br>* Using existing classes and creating objects<br>* Creating your own classes<br>* Using Basic Standard Template Library classes such as Vector<br>* Constructors and Destructors<br>* Copy and Move semantics including Copy constructors, Move constructors, and copy and move assignment&nbsp;<br>* How to overload operators<br>* Using inheritance and class hierarchies<br>* Using Polymorphic functions and dynamic binding&nbsp;<br>* Using smart pointers<br>* Using stream I/O<br>* An introduction to the C++ STL<br>* An introduction to Exception Handling<br>* And much more.</p><p><br><strong>How is this C++ course different from other courses?<br><br></strong>You will learn Modern C++, for one. &nbsp;<strong>Many, perhaps most other courses on Udemy teach you old, obsolete versions of C++.</strong> &nbsp;If you are going to learn C++, it's imperative that you learn the Modern version to maximize your career opportunities and to ensure your skills are up to date.</p><p>The course format includes theory and concepts which are then reinforced with live code examples. Often the C++ debugger is used to step through code and analyze variables to better understand the behavior of C++. The instructor also uses a pen tablet to write on the screen and provide even more visual explanations.</p><p>You won't find better C++ training anywhere, and you will struggle to find someone with as much industry and training experience as&nbsp;your instructor Frank has.</p><p><strong>What do I get out of learning C++?</strong></p><p>More career options for one! &nbsp;C++ is one of the most popular programming languages used in games development. &nbsp; &nbsp;It's also heavily used in embedded applications. &nbsp;Your investment in time in learning C++ will reward you time and time again with more pay, and more opportunities, and frankly, more fun!</p><p><strong>Are you ready to get started?</strong></p><p>If you are ready to get that first paid programming job or to move up to a more senior programming position, then this course is for you! </p><p>Your new job or consulting opportunity&nbsp;awaits! &nbsp;\n</p><p>Why not get started today?</p><p>Click the&nbsp;<strong>Signup</strong>&nbsp;button to sign up for the course!</p>",

We'll cover all the core basics but we'll not stop thereafter - this course also dives into advanced concepts like the Composition API introduced with Vue 3.</p><p>Frontend frameworks like Vue JS are <strong>extremely popular</strong> because they give us this reactive, great user experience we know from mobile apps - but now in the browser! No wonder that <strong>jobs</strong> requiring frontend framework skills like VueJS are amongst the <strong>best paid</strong> ones in the industry!</p><p>You may know Angular 2+ and ReactJS, well, <strong>VueJS combines the best of both frameworks</strong> and makes building anything from <strong>small widgets to big, enterprise-level apps</strong> a breeze and a whole lot of fun!</p><p>And if you don't know the two mentioned frameworks: That's fine, too, <strong>this course does not expect any knowledge</strong> of any other frontend framework - you will learn it all throughout this Course!</p><p><strong>This course covers it all!</strong></p><p>We'll start at the very basics, what Vue.js is and how it works before we move on to more complex and advanced topics but I'll be honest: It's too much to fit it all into one sentence, so here's what you'll learn in this Course:</p><ul><li><p><strong>What</strong> is VueJS and <strong>Why</strong> would you use it?</p></li><li><p>The <strong>Basics</strong> (including the basic Syntax, Understanding Templates and much more!)</p></li><li><p>How to Output <strong>Reactive Data</strong> &amp; Listen to <strong>Events</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Interacting with DOM</strong> (Rendering Lists, Conditionally attaching/ detaching Elements ...)</p></li><li><p>Setting up a <strong>Development Environment</strong> and <strong>Workflow</strong></p></li><li><p>Using <strong>Components</strong> (and what Components are to begin with)</p></li><li><p>A <strong>Deep Dive Look Behind the Scenes</strong> of Vue</p></li><li><p>Binding to <strong>Form</strong> Inputs</p></li><li><p>Sending <strong>Http Requests</strong> to Backend APIs</p></li><li><p><strong>Authentication</strong> &amp; Vue</p></li><li><p>How to make your App more Beautiful with <strong>Animations</strong> and <strong>Transitions</strong></p></li><li><p>How to create an awesome <strong>Single-Page-Application</strong> (SPA) with <strong>Routing</strong></p></li><li><p>How to improve State Management by using <strong>Vuex</strong></p></li><li><p>How to <strong>Deploy</strong> the App</p></li><li><p><strong>And much more!</strong></p></li></ul><p>All these topics are taught with<strong> real examples and demo projects.</strong> This course is full of exercises, challenges and bigger courser projects that allow you to practice what you learned.</p><p>Along with <strong>many other smaller projects</strong>, we will build a <strong>couple of bigger main projects</strong>:</p><ul><li><p>The <strong>\"Monster Slayer\" Game</strong> - a game running in the browser, 100% powered by Vue</p></li><li><p>The <strong>\"Learning Resource Manager\" </strong>- a web app that allows you to manage (add, delete, list) your favorite learning resources</p></li><li><p>The <strong>\"Find a Coach\" app</strong> - a web app that allows you to sign up / login, register as a coach, list and filter available coaches and send messages to coaches</p></li></ul><p><strong>Is this course for you?</strong></p><p>Now that you know what this course is about, let's see if this course is for you!</p><p><strong>Here are three types of students who will love this course:</strong></p><p><strong>Student #1:</strong></p><p>Has some JavaScript experience and is interested in what this language can do. You heard and read that JavaScript allows you to create nice web applications and enhance existing web pages. VueJS is your choice!</p><p><strong>Student #2:</strong></p><p>You already have some experience with other frontend frameworks like Angular (2+) or ReactJS. But either due to interest or disappointment of the existing frameworks, you seek some alternatives - VueJS might be what you were looking for!</p><p><strong>Student #3:</strong></p><p>Has experience with backend frameworks/ languages but now also wants to enter the frontend world. VueJS is an awesome choice here, it's fun, it uses native JS and it's extremely powerful!</p><p><strong>Bonus: Student #4</strong></p><p>Is disappointed by Angular 2+. Does a good framework need 2 hours of setup? No, certainly not - as VueJS will prove to this student!</p><p><strong>Let's dive into VueJS right now!</strong></p>",

You will learn it.  <strong>AWS Deployment</strong>? Included.  <strong>Kubernetes in Production</strong>? Of course!</p><p>This is the ultimate course to learn how to deploy <em>any</em> web application you can possibly dream up.  Docker and Kubernetes are the newest tech in the Dev Ops world, and have dramatically changed the flow of creating and deploying web apps.  Docker is a technology that allows applications to run in constructs called 'containers', while Kubernetes allows for many different 'containers' to run in coordination.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Docker from Scratch!</strong></p><p>In this course you'll <strong>learn Docker from absolute fundamentals</strong>, beginning by learning the answer to basic questions such as \"What is a container?\" and \"How does a container work?\".  From the very first few lectures, we will do a <strong>deep dive on the inner workings of containers</strong>, so you get a core understanding of exactly how they are implemented.  Once you understand what a container is, you'll learn how to work with them using basic Docker CLI commands.  After that, you'll apply your new-found mastery of the Docker CLI to build your own custom images, effectively 'Dockerizing' your own personal applications.  </p><p><br></p><p><strong>CI + CD Pipelines</strong></p><p>Of course, no course on Docker would be complete without a full understanding of common Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment patterns.  You will learn how to implement <strong>a full CI + CD workflow </strong>using Github, Travis CI, and Amazon Web Services, creating a pipeline that <strong>automatically deploys your code</strong> every time you push your latest changes to Github!</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Multi-Container Deployments on AWS!</strong></p><p>After building a deployment pipeline, you'll apply it to master both single-container and multi-container <strong>deployments on Amazon Web Services.  </strong>You will construct a multi-container application utilizing <strong>Node, React, Redis, and Postgres</strong>, and see the amazing power of containers in action (Note: all Javascript coding in this course is optional, the full source code is provided if you don't want to write JS).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Kubernetes!</strong></p><p>Finally, you will tackle Kubernetes, a production-grade system for managing complex applications with many different running containers.  You will learn the <strong>right way to build a Kubernetes Cluster</strong> - this course doesn't have any of those annoying <em>\"don't do this in production\" </em>comments!  You will first build a Kubernetes Cluster on your local machine, then eventually move it over to a cloud provider.  You'll even learn how to <strong>set up HTTPS on Kubernetes</strong>, which is harder than it sounds!</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Here's what you'll do:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Learn Docker from scratch, <strong>no previous experience required</strong></p></li><li><p>Build your own <strong>custom images </strong>tailored to your applications</p></li><li><p>Master the Docker CLI to <strong>inspect and debug</strong> running containers</p></li><li><p>Understand <strong>how Docker works</strong> behind the scenes, and what a container is</p></li><li><p>Build a<strong> CI + CD pipeline</strong> from scratch with Github, Travis CI, and AWS</p></li><li><p><strong>Automatically deploy</strong> your code when it is pushed to Github!</p></li><li><p>Build a <strong>complex multi-container application</strong> from scratch and deploy it to AWS</p></li><li><p>Understand the purpose and <strong>theory of Kubernetes</strong></p></li><li><p>Deploy a<strong> production-ready Kubernetes</strong> Cluster to Google Cloud</p></li></ul>",

Join a live online community of over 900,000+ developers and a course taught by an industry expert that has actually worked both in Silicon Valley and Toronto.</strong> <strong>Graduates of Andrei’s courses are now working at Google, Tesla, Amazon, Apple, IBM, JP Morgan, Meta, + other top tech companies.</strong></p><p>Learn Python from scratch, get hired, and have fun along the way with the most modern, up-to-date Python course on Udemy (we use the latest version of Python). This course is focused on efficiency: never spend time on confusing, out of date, incomplete Python tutorials anymore. </p><p>This comprehensive and<strong> </strong>project based course<strong> will introduce you to all of the modern skills of a Python developer (Python 3) and along the way, we will build over 12 real world projects to add to your portfolio </strong>(You will get access to all the the code from the 12+ projects we build, so that you can put them on your portfolio right away)!</p><p><br>The curriculum is going to be very hands on as we walk you from start to finish of becoming a professional Python developer.&nbsp;We will start from the very beginning by teaching you Python basics and programming fundamentals, and then going into advanced topics and different career fields in Python so you can get real life practice and be ready for the real world. <br><br>The topics covered in this course are:</p><p><br></p><p>- <strong>Programming Fundamentals</strong></p><p>- <strong>Python Basics</strong></p><p><strong>- Python Fundamentals</strong></p><p><strong>- Data Structures</strong></p><p><strong>- Object Oriented Programming with Python</strong></p><p><strong>- Functional Programming with Python</strong></p><p><strong>- Lambdas</strong></p><p><strong>- Decorators</strong></p><p><strong>- Generators</strong></p><p><strong>- Testing in Python</strong></p><p><strong>- Debugging</strong></p><p><strong>- Error Handling</strong></p><p><strong>- Regular Expressions</strong></p><p><strong>- Comprehensions</strong></p><p><strong>- Modules</strong></p><p><strong>- Virtual Environments</strong></p><p><strong>- Developer Environments (PyCharm, Jupyter Notebooks, VS&nbsp;Code, Sublime Text + more)</strong></p><p><strong>- File Processing: Image, CSV, PDFs, Text + more</strong></p><p><strong>- Web Development with Python</strong></p><p><strong>- Machine Learning with Python</strong></p><p><strong>- Data Science with Python</strong></p><p><strong>- Automation with Python and Selenium</strong></p><p><strong>- Scripting with Python</strong></p><p><strong>- Web Scraping with Python and BeautifulSoup</strong></p><p><strong>- Image Detection</strong></p><p><strong>- Data Visualizations</strong></p><p><strong>- Kaggle, Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn</strong></p><p><strong>- Email and SMS with Python</strong></p><p><strong>- Working with APIs (Twitter Bot, Password&nbsp;Checker, Translator)</strong></p><p><br></p><p>By the end of this course, you will be a complete Python developer that can get hired at large companies. We are going to use Python to work with Email, Text Messages, CSV files, PDF files, Image Files, Data Visualizations, build our own machine learning model and perform Image detection. We are going to build a web scraper for HackerNews, build a Twitter bot,&nbsp; build the most secure password checker and we will also build some automation tools using Selenium. But the best part? We will build an actual portfolio website using Python that your future employer and customers can contact you at. By the end, you will have a stack of projects you have built that you can show off to others.</p><p><br></p><p>Here’s the truth: Most courses teach you Python and do just that. They show you how to get started. But the thing is you don’t know where to go from there or how to build your own projects. </p><p><br></p><p>Whether you are new to programming, or want to level up your Python skills, or are coming from a different programming language, this course is for you. This course is not about making you just code along without understanding the principles so that when you are done with the course you don’t know what to do other than watch another tutorial. No! <strong>This course will push you and challenge you to go from an absolute beginner with no coding experience to someone that can go off, forget about me, and build their own applications and get hired.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Taught By:</strong></p><p>Andrei&nbsp;Neagoie is the instructor of the <strong>highest rated Development courses on Udemy as well as&nbsp;one of the fastest&nbsp;growing.&nbsp;</strong>His graduates have&nbsp;moved&nbsp;on to work for&nbsp;some of the biggest tech&nbsp;companies around the world like Apple, Google, Amazon, JP Morgan, IBM, UNIQLO etc...&nbsp;He&nbsp;has&nbsp;been working as a senior software developer in&nbsp;Silicon Valley and Toronto for many years,&nbsp;and&nbsp;is now taking all that he has learned,&nbsp;to teach&nbsp;programming skills and&nbsp;to help you&nbsp;discover the amazing career opportunities that being a developer allows in&nbsp;life.&nbsp;</p><p>Having been&nbsp;a self taught programmer,&nbsp;he understands that there is an&nbsp;overwhelming number of online courses, tutorials and books&nbsp;that are overly verbose and inadequate at teaching proper skills.&nbsp;Most people feel paralyzed and don't know where to start when learning a complex subject matter, or even worse, most people don't have $20,000 to spend on a coding bootcamp.&nbsp;<strong>Programming skills should be affordable and open to all. An education material&nbsp;should teach real life skills that are current and&nbsp;they should not waste a student's valuable time.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Having learned important&nbsp;lessons from working for Fortune 500 companies, tech startups, to even&nbsp;founding his own business, he is now dedicating 100% of his time to&nbsp;teaching others valuable&nbsp;software development skills&nbsp;in order to take control of their life and work in an exciting industry with infinite possibilities.&nbsp;</p><p>Andrei promises you that there are no other courses out there as comprehensive and as well explained.&nbsp;<strong>He believes that in order to learn anything of value, you need to start with the foundation and develop the roots of the tree. Only from there will you be able to learn concepts and specific skills(leaves) that connect to the foundation. Learning becomes exponential when structured in this way.</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Taking his experience in educational psychology and coding, Andrei's courses will take you on an understanding of complex subjects that you never thought would be possible.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><p><strong>See you inside the course!</strong></p>",

Ever. In the entire universe. She is hilarious and teaches in a lighthearted and fun way that is also very clear to understand. I instantly purchased this course as soon as I saw it was released because I know Angela delivers the highest quality educational content possible. 100% recommend this course (as well as every other course she's created). Thank you Angela for helping me as I make a career pivot into becoming a hybrid UX designer/mobile developer!\" - Jacob Pernell</p><p>\"Angela is my favorite Udemy professor for coding courses. Her methods for building onto the material so that you're never progressing too fast or too slow make for a really engaging learning experience. She's thorough in her explanations, and uses fun projects to discuss the material. I had started a couple other Flutter courses before finding this one, and I've progressed more in 24hrs than I did in a week with the other courses. Would love an advanced Flutter course from Angela to tackle once I'm done with this one!\" - Jerome Llouche</p><p><em>\"You will not find a better teacher than Angela. She does a wonderful job of encouraging you to learn swift the right way. I want to encourage everyone thinking about taking this class to get it,&nbsp;as it is the </em><strong><em>BEST programming class</em></strong><em> I've seen on anywhere and I've tried more than a few of them. If you are looking for an excellent swift programming course, stop there here because you have found it. You will learn Swift from the very beginning of programming all the way through making your own apps that you can upload to the App store.\" - Ian Hopjins</em></p><p><em>\"SO GOOD!!!&nbsp;</em><strong><em>Retention rate is incredible</em></strong><em> because Angela does a great job in explaining and teaching every aspect of what we are doing. Most of the other instructors on Udemy put code on the screen and pretend nothing happened. This course is amazing! 5/5\"</em> -&nbsp;Muhammad Ibrahim</p><p><em>\"Angela is a </em><strong><em>spectacular</em></strong><em> teacher!\"</em> -&nbsp;Marco Zanirato</p><p><em>\"This course was terrific. Only after taking a few more courses from others that I</em><strong><em> realized how good this course</em></strong><em> was. This course taught me more than I was expecting, it provided great instructions and a lot of hands-on tasks to drill-in the concept.\" -&nbsp;Marc</em></p><p><em>\"Best use of your money! I was a complete beginner but </em><strong><em>Angela made me a pro</em></strong><em> in weeks.\"</em> -&nbsp;Burak Tunçbilek</p><p><em>\"IT IS #1!!!!!!!!! Absolutely Amazing. The best iOS course i have ever taken. Angela explains everything the way it needs to be explained, so everything is easily understood. The concept of </em><strong><em>this course is built to make you learn, not just watch</em></strong><em> and repeat. Angela is highly educated and it is very much noticeable during the entire course. Again, it is fantastic. Thank you. Please create more courses!!!!!\"</em> -&nbsp;Eduard Khachian</p><p><strong>Are you trying to choose between all the different Flutter&nbsp;courses on Udemy? Take a look at what students on my course had to say about this:</strong></p><p><em>I have revamped my expectation for what a</em><strong><em> 5 star course </em></strong><em>should be for Udemy. Angela, you're awesome! I already rated the course as 5 stars early on (at about 20% completion), but after completing roughly 70% of the course, I can say this is my favourite Udemy course as of today. Brilliant course Angela!</em> - Alberto L</p><p><em>\"I took a lot of courses on Udemy and elsewhere and non of them were as clear and perfectly paced as this one! Angelas approach is really awesome, </em><strong><em>deep and clear</em></strong><em>.\" -&nbsp;Žan Fras</em></p><p><em>\"I have taken several iOS courses, so far this course had the </em><strong><em>best explanation </em></strong><em>on swift and xcode documentation. The lecturer is kinda humorous sometimes which make this course even more enjoyable.\" -&nbsp;Bryan Pukanda</em></p><p><em>\"I have taken lots of courses on udemy and elsewhere for self learning and i can tell you with all the honesty this is one course which </em><strong><em>i did not want it to end</em></strong><em>. It is like one of those movies that you wish keeps going. Whatever concepts are covered were covered very beautifully and made learning quite simple. I got so many answers to Why? in this course like how closures work and why they work that way... why delegates work that way. Thank you so much for this course.\" - Arun Lakhera</em></p><p><em>\"I compare this to another top iOS class on Udemy, but I think that this one beats it. The reason? Angela doesn't show you a plethora of material and then say that we will discuss this later, or say \"just do this. You will see why later.\" She goes into the </em><strong><em>reason for doing something</em></strong><em> before doing it.\"</em> &nbsp;-&nbsp;Clyde Addison</p><p><br></p><p><strong>REMEMBER… I'm so confident that you'll love this course that&nbsp;we're offering a FULL money back guarantee for&nbsp;30 days!

The combination of Java, Spring Boot, Spring Web MVC, Spring Web Services and JPA makes it even more fun. And its even more fun to create Microservices.</p><p>There are <strong>two parts</strong> to this course - RESTful web services and Microservices</p><p>Architectures are moving towards microservices.&nbsp;RESTful web services are the <strong>first step</strong> to developing great microservices. Java and Spring Boot, in combination with Spring Web MVC (also called Spring REST) makes it easy to develop RESTful web services.</p><p><strong>In the first part of the course</strong>, you will <strong>learn the basics of RESTful web services</strong> developing resources for a social media application. You will learn to implement these resources with multiple features - <strong>versioning</strong>, exception handling, <strong>documentation</strong> (Swagger), basic authentication (Spring Security), <strong>filtering</strong> and HATEOAS. You will learn the <strong>best practices</strong> in <strong>designing RESTful web services</strong>.</p><p>In this part of the course, you will be using Spring (Dependency Management), Spring MVC (or Spring REST), Spring Boot, Spring Security (Authentication and Authorization), Spring Boot Actuator (Monitoring), Swagger (Documentation), Maven (dependencies management), Eclipse (IDE), Postman (REST Services Client) and Tomcat Embedded Web Server. We will help you set up each one of these.</p><p><strong>In the second part of the course</strong>, you will learn the <strong>basics of Microservices</strong>. You will understand how to implement microservices using Spring Cloud.</p><p>In this part of the course, you will learn to establish communication between microservices, enable load balancing, scaling up and down of microservices. You will also learn to centralize the configuration of microservices with Spring Cloud Config Server. You will implement Eureka Naming Server and Distributed tracing with Spring Cloud Sleuth and Zipkin. You will create fault tolerant microservices with Zipkin.</p><p><strong>In the third part of the course</strong>, you will learn the <strong>basics of Docker</strong>. You will understand how to build containers for microservices built using Docker and Spring Cloud.</p><p><strong>In the fourth part of the course</strong>, you will learn the <strong>basics of Kubernetes</strong>. You will understand how to orchestrate microservices with Kubernetes.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>WHAT&nbsp;TO&nbsp;EXPECT&nbsp;FROM&nbsp;EVERY&nbsp;IN28MINUTES&nbsp;COURSE</strong></p><p>in28Minutes offers 50+ Best Selling Courses providing Amazing Learning Experiences to <strong>1 MILLION</strong> Learners across the world.</p><p>Each of these courses come with </p><ul><li><p>Amazing Hands-on Step By Step Learning Experiences </p></li><li><p>Real Project Experiences using the Best Tools and Frameworks </p></li><li><p>Awesome Troubleshooting Guides with 200+ FAQs Answered </p></li><li><p>Friendly Support in the Q&amp;A section </p></li><li><p>Free Udemy Certificate of Completion on Completion of Course</p></li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>HERE&nbsp;ARE&nbsp;A&nbsp;FEW&nbsp;REVIEWS&nbsp;ON&nbsp;THE&nbsp;IN28MINUTES&nbsp;WAY</strong></p><p><strong>5 STARS -</strong> Excellent, fabulous. The way he has prepared the material and the way he teaches is really awesome. What an effort .. Thanks a million </p><p><strong>5 STARS -</strong> A lot of preparation work has taken place from the teacher and this is visible throughout the course. </p><p><strong>5 STARS -</strong> This guy is fantastic. Really. Wonderful teaching skills, and goes well out of his way to make sure that everything he is doing is fully understood. This is the kind of tutorial that gets me excited to work with a framework that I may otherwise not be. </p><p><strong>5 STARS -</strong> The best part of it is the hands-on approach which the author maintained throughout the course as he had promised at the beginning of the lecture. He explains the concepts really well and also makes sure that there is not a single line of code you type without understanding what it really does. </p><p><strong>5 STARS -</strong> I also appreciate the mind and hands approach of teaching something and then having the student apply it. It makes everything a lot clearer for the student and uncovers issues that we will face in our project early. </p><p><strong>5 STARS -</strong> Amazing course. Explained super difficult concepts (that I have spent hours on the internet finding a good explanation) in under 5 minutes.</p><p><strong>Start Learning Now.</strong> Hit the Enroll Button!</p><p><br></p><p><strong>STEP&nbsp;BY&nbsp;STEP&nbsp;DETAILS</strong></p><p><strong><em>RESTful Web Services&nbsp;</em></strong></p><ul><li><p>Step 01 - Initializing a RESTful Services Project with Spring Boot</p></li><li><p>Step 02 - Understanding the RESTful Services we would create in this course</p></li><li><p>Step 03 - Creating a Hello World Service</p></li><li><p>Step 04 - Enhancing the Hello World Service to return a Bean</p></li><li><p>Step 05 - Quick Review of Spring Boot Auto Configuration and Dispatcher Servlet - What's happening in the background?</p></li><li><p>Step 06 - Enhancing the Hello World Service with a Path Variable</p></li><li><p>Step 07 - Creating User Bean and User Service</p></li><li><p>Step 08 - Implementing GET Methods for User Resource</p></li><li><p>Step 09 - Implementing POST Method to create User Resource</p></li><li><p>Step 10 - Enhancing POST Method to return correct HTTP Status Code and Location URI</p></li><li><p>Step 11 - Implementing Exception Handling - 404 Resource Not Found</p></li><li><p>Step 12 - Implementing Generic Exception Handling for all Resources</p></li><li><p>Step 13 - Exercise : User Post Resource and Exception Handling</p></li><li><p>Step 14 - Implementing DELETE Method to delete a User Resource</p></li><li><p>Step 15 - Implementing Validations for RESTful Services</p></li><li><p>Step 16 - Implementing HATEOAS for RESTful Services</p></li><li><p>Step 17 - Overview of Advanced RESTful Service Features</p></li><li><p>Step 18 - Internationalization for RESTful Services</p></li><li><p>Step 19 - Content Negotiation - Implementing Support for XML</p></li><li><p>Step 20 - Configuring Auto Generation of Swagger Documentation</p></li><li><p>Step 21 - Introduction to Swagger Documentation Format</p></li><li><p>Step 22 - Enhancing Swagger Documentation with Custom Annotations</p></li><li><p>Step 23 - Monitoring APIs with Spring Boot Actuator</p></li><li><p>Step 24 - Implementing Static Filtering for RESTful Service</p></li><li><p>Step 25 - Implementing Dynamic Filtering for RESTful Service</p></li><li><p>Step 26 - Versioning RESTful Services - Basic Approach with URIs</p></li><li><p>Step 27 - Versioning RESTful Services - Header and Content Negotiation Approaches</p></li><li><p>Step 28 - Implementing Basic Authentication with Spring Security</p></li><li><p>Step 29 - Overview of Connecting RESTful Service to JPA</p></li><li><p>Step 30 - Creating User Entity and some test data</p></li><li><p>Step 31 - Updating GET methods on User Resource to use JPA</p></li><li><p>Step 32 - Updating POST and DELETE methods on User Resource to use JPA</p></li><li><p>Step 33 - Creating Post Entity and Many to One Relationship with User Entity</p></li><li><p>Step 34 - Implementing a GET service to retrieve all Posts of a User</p></li><li><p>Step 35 - Implementing a POST service to create a Post for a User</p></li><li><p>Step 36 - Richardson Maturity Model</p></li><li><p>Step 37 - RESTful Services Best Practices</p></li></ul><p><strong><em>Microservices with Spring Cloud</em></strong></p><ul><li><p>Step 01 - Setting up Limits Microservice</p></li><li><p>Step 02 - Creating a hard coded limits service</p></li><li><p>Step 03 - Enhance limits service to pick up configuration from application properties</p></li><li><p>Step 04 - Setting up Spring Cloud Config Server</p></li><li><p>Step 05 - Installing Git and Creating Local Git Repository</p></li><li><p>Step 06 - Connect Spring Cloud Config Server to Local Git Repository</p></li><li><p>Step 07 - Connect Limits Service to Spring Cloud Config Server</p></li><li><p>Step 08 - Configuring Profiles for Limits Service</p></li><li><p>Step 09 - Introduction to Currency Conversion and Currency Exchange Microservices</p></li><li><p>Step 10 - Setting up Currency Exchange Microservice</p></li><li><p>Step 11 - Create a simple hard coded currency exchange service</p></li><li><p>Step 12 - Setting up Dynamic Port in the the Response</p></li><li><p>Step 13 - Configure JPA and Initialized Data</p></li><li><p>Step 14 - Create a JPA Repository</p></li><li><p>Step 15 - Setting up Currency Conversion Microservice</p></li><li><p>Step 16 - Creating a service for currency conversion</p></li><li><p>Step 17 - Invoking Currency Exchange Microservice from Currency Conversion Microservice</p></li><li><p>Step 18 - Using Feign REST Client for Service Invocation</p></li><li><p>Step 19 - Understand Naming Server and Setting up Eureka Naming Server</p></li><li><p>Step 20 - Connect Currency Conversion Microservice &amp;

Not to mention its applications in build workflows for projects of all sizes.</p><p><strong>This course will teach you all of that!</strong>&nbsp;From scratch with zero prior knowledge assumed. Though if you do bring some knowledge, you'll of course be able to quickly jump into the course modules that are most interesting to you.</p><p><strong>Here's what you'll learn in this course:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Node.js Basics &amp;&nbsp;Basic Core Modules</p></li><li><p>Parsing Requests &amp;&nbsp;Sending Responses</p></li><li><p>Rendering HTML&nbsp;Dynamically (on the Server)</p></li><li><p>Using Express.js</p></li><li><p>Working with Files and generating PDFs on the Server (on-the-fly)</p></li><li><p>File Up- and Download</p></li><li><p>Using the Model-View-Controller (MVC)&nbsp;Pattern</p></li><li><p>Using Node.js with SQL&nbsp;(MySQL) and Sequelize</p></li><li><p>Using Node.js with NoSQL&nbsp;(MongoDB)&nbsp;and Mongoose</p></li><li><p>Working with Sessions &amp;&nbsp;Cookies</p></li><li><p>User Authentication and Authorization</p></li><li><p>Sending E-Mails</p></li><li><p>Validating User Input</p></li><li><p>Data Pagination</p></li><li><p>Handling Payments with Stripe.js</p></li><li><p>Building REST&nbsp;APIs</p></li><li><p>Authentication in REST&nbsp;APIs</p></li><li><p>File Upload in REST&nbsp;APIs</p></li><li><p>Building GraphQL&nbsp;APIs</p></li><li><p>Authentication in GraphQL&nbsp;APIs</p></li><li><p>File Upload in GraphQL&nbsp;APIs</p></li><li><p>Building a Realtime Node.js App with Websockets</p></li><li><p>Automated Testing (Unit Tests)</p></li><li><p>Deploying a Node.js Application</p></li><li><p>Using TypeScript with Node.js</p></li><li><p>Exploring Deno.js</p></li><li><p>And Way More!</p></li></ul><p>Does this look like a lot of content?&nbsp;It certainly is!</p><p>This is not a short course but it is the \"Complete Guide\"&nbsp;on Node.js after all. We'll dive into a lot of topics and we'll not just scratch the surface.</p><p>We'll also not just walk through boring theory and some slides. Instead, we'll build <strong>two major projects</strong>: An online shop (including checkout + payments) and a blog.</p><p>All topics and features of the course will be shown and used in these projects and you'll therefore learn about them in a realistic environment.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Is this course for you?</strong></p><p>If you got <strong>no Node.js experience</strong>, you'll love this course because it starts with zero knowledge assumed. It's the perfect course to become a Node.js developer.</p><p>If you got <strong>basic Node.js experience</strong>, this course is also a perfect match because you can go through the basic modules quickly and you'll benefit from all the deep dives and advanced topics the course covers.</p><p>Are you an <strong>advanced Node.js</strong> user?&nbsp;Check the curriculum then. Maybe you found no other course that shows how to use SQL&nbsp;with Node.js. Or you're interested in GraphQL. Chances are, that you'll get a lot of value out of this course, too!</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong></p><ul><li><p>NO&nbsp;Node.js knowledge is required at all!</p></li><li><p>NO&nbsp;other programming language knowledge (besides JavaScript, see next point) is required</p></li><li><p>Basic JavaScript knowledge is assumed though - you should at least be willing to pick it up whilst going through the course. A JS&nbsp;refresher module exists to bring you up to the latest syntax quickly</p></li><li><p>Basic HTML&nbsp;+ CSS&nbsp;knowledge helps but is NOT&nbsp;required</p></li></ul>",

            "description": "<p>***&nbsp;As seen on Kickstarter ***</p><p>Artificial intelligence is growing exponentially. There is no doubt about that. Self-driving cars are clocking up millions of miles, IBM Watson is diagnosing patients better than armies of doctors and Google Deepmind's AlphaGo beat the World champion at Go - a game where intuition plays a key role.\n\n&nbsp; </p><p>But the further AI advances, the more complex become the problems it needs to solve. And only Deep Learning can solve such complex problems and that's why it's at the heart of Artificial intelligence.\n\n&nbsp; </p><p><strong>--- Why Deep&nbsp;Learning A-Z? ---</strong>\n\n&nbsp; </p><p>Here are five reasons we think Deep Learning A-Z&nbsp;really is different, and stands out from the crowd of&nbsp;other training programs out there:\n\n&nbsp; </p><p><strong>1. ROBUST STRUCTURE&nbsp;</strong>\n\n&nbsp; </p><p>The first and most important thing we focused on is giving the course a robust structure. Deep Learning is very broad and complex and to navigate this maze you need a clear and global vision of it.&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp; </p><p>That's why we grouped the tutorials into two volumes, representing the two fundamental branches of Deep Learning: Supervised Deep Learning and Unsupervised Deep Learning.&nbsp;With each volume focusing on three distinct algorithms, we found that this is the best structure for mastering Deep Learning.\n\n&nbsp; </p><p><strong>2. INTUITION TUTORIALS</strong>\n\n&nbsp; </p><p>So many courses and books just bombard you with the theory, and math, and coding... But they forget to explain, perhaps, the most important part:&nbsp;<strong>why you are doing what you are doing.&nbsp;</strong>And that's how this course is so different. We focus on developing an intuitive&nbsp;<em>*feel*</em>&nbsp;for the concepts behind Deep Learning algorithms.\n\n&nbsp; </p><p>With our intuition tutorials you will be confident that you understand all the techniques on an instinctive level. And once you proceed to the hands-on coding exercises you will see for yourself how much more meaningful your experience will be.&nbsp;This is a game-changer.\n\n&nbsp; </p><p><strong>3. EXCITING PROJECTS</strong>\n\n&nbsp; </p><p>Are you tired of courses based on over-used, outdated data sets?\n\n&nbsp; </p><p>Yes? Well then you're in for a treat.\n\n&nbsp; </p><p>Inside this class we will work on Real-World datasets, to solve Real-World business problems. (Definitely not the boring iris or digit classification datasets that we see in every course). In this course we will solve six real-world challenges:\n\n&nbsp; </p><ul><li><p>Artificial Neural Networks to solve a Customer Churn problem\n\n&nbsp; </p></li><li><p>Convolutional Neural Networks for Image Recognition\n\n&nbsp; </p></li><li><p>Recurrent&nbsp;Neural Networks to predict Stock Prices\n\n&nbsp; </p></li><li><p>Self-Organizing Maps to investigate Fraud\n\n&nbsp; </p></li><li><p>Boltzmann Machines to create a Recomender System\n\n&nbsp; </p></li><li><p>Stacked Autoencoders* to take on the challenge for the&nbsp;<strong>Netflix $1 Million prize</strong>\n\n&nbsp; </p></li></ul><p><em>*Stacked Autoencoders is a brand new technique in Deep Learning which didn't even exist a couple of years ago. We haven't seen this method explained anywhere else in sufficient depth.</em>\n\n&nbsp; </p><p><strong>4. HANDS-ON CODING&nbsp;</strong>\n\n&nbsp; </p><p>In&nbsp;Deep Learning A-Z we code together with you.&nbsp;Every practical tutorial starts with a blank page and we write up the code from scratch. This way you can follow along and understand exactly how the code comes together and what each line means.&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp; </p><p>In addition, we will purposefully structure the code in such a way so that you can download it and apply it in your own projects.&nbsp;Moreover, we explain step-by-step where and how to modify the code to insert YOUR dataset, to tailor the algorithm to your needs, to get the output that you are after.&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp; </p><p>This is a course which naturally extends into your career.\n\n&nbsp; </p><p><strong>5. IN-COURSE SUPPORT</strong>\n\n&nbsp; </p><p>Have you ever taken a course or read a book where you have questions but cannot reach the author?&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp; </p><p>Well, this course is different. We are fully committed to making this the most disruptive and powerful Deep Learning course on the planet. With that comes a responsibility to constantly be there when you need our help.\n\n&nbsp; </p><p>In fact, since we physically also need to eat and sleep we have put together a team of professional Data Scientists to help us out. Whenever you ask a question you will get a response from us within 48 hours maximum.&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp; </p><p>No matter how complex your query, we will be there.&nbsp;The bottom line is we want you to succeed.&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp; </p><p><strong>---&nbsp;The Tools&nbsp;---</strong>\n\n&nbsp; </p><p>Tensorflow and Pytorch are the two most popular open-source libraries for Deep Learning. In this course you will learn both!\n\n&nbsp; </p><p>TensorFlow was developed by Google and is used in their speech recognition system, in the new google photos product, gmail, google search and much more. Companies using Tensorflow include AirBnb, Airbus, Ebay, Intel, Uber and dozens more.&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp; </p><p>PyTorch is as just as powerful and is being developed by researchers at Nvidia and leading universities: Stanford, Oxford, ParisTech. Companies using PyTorch include Twitter, Saleforce and Facebook.\n\n&nbsp; </p><p>So which is better and for what?&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp; </p><p>Well, in this course you will have an opportunity to work with both and understand when Tensorflow is better and when PyTorch is the way to go. Throughout the tutorials we compare the two and give you tips and ideas on which could work best in certain circumstances.\n\n&nbsp; </p><p>The interesting thing is that both these libraries are barely over 1 year old. That's what we mean when we say that in this course we teach you the most cutting edge Deep Learning models and techniques.\n\n&nbsp; </p><p><strong>--- More&nbsp;Tools&nbsp;---</strong>\n\n&nbsp; </p><p><em>Theano&nbsp;</em>is another open source deep learning library. It's very similar to Tensorflow in its functionality, but nevertheless we will still cover it.\n\n&nbsp; </p><p><em>Keras&nbsp;</em>is an incredible library to implement Deep Learning models. It acts as a wrapper for Theano and Tensorflow. Thanks to Keras we can create powerful and complex Deep Learning models with only a few lines of code. This is what will allow you to have a global vision of what you are creating. Everything you make will look so clear and structured thanks to this library, that you will really get the intuition and understanding of what you are doing.\n\n&nbsp; </p><p><strong>--- Even More&nbsp;Tools&nbsp;---</strong>\n\n&nbsp; </p><p><em>Scikit-learn&nbsp;</em>the most practical Machine Learning library. We will mainly use it: &nbsp;\n\n&nbsp; </p><ul><li><p>to evaluate the performance of our models with the most relevant technique, k-Fold Cross Validation\n\n&nbsp; </p></li><li><p>to improve our models with effective Parameter Tuning\n\n&nbsp; </p></li><li><p>to preprocess our data, so that our models can learn in the best conditions\n\n&nbsp; </p></li></ul><p>And of course, we have to mention the usual suspects. This whole course is based on Python and in every single section you will be getting hours and hours of invaluable hands-on practical coding experience.&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp; </p><p>Plus, throughout the course we will be using&nbsp;Numpy to do high computations and manipulate high dimensional arrays,&nbsp;Matplotlib to plot insightful charts and&nbsp;Pandas to import and manipulate datasets the most efficiently.\n\n&nbsp; </p><p><strong>--- Who Is This Course For?&nbsp;---</strong>\n\n&nbsp; </p><p>As you can see, there are lots of different tools in the space of Deep Learning and in this course we make sure to show you the most important and most progressive ones so that when you're done with Deep Learning A-Z your skills are on the cutting edge of today's technology.&nbsp; &nbsp; </p><p><strong>If you are just starting out into Deep Learning,&nbsp;</strong>then you will find this course extremely useful. Deep Learning A-Z is structured around special coding blueprint approaches meaning that you won't get bogged down in unnecessary programming or mathematical complexities and instead you will be applying Deep Learning techniques from very early on in the course.&nbsp;You will build your knowledge from the ground up and you will see how with every tutorial you are getting more and more confident.&nbsp; &nbsp; </p><p><strong>If you already have experience with Deep Learning,&nbsp;</strong>you will find this course refreshing, inspiring and very practical. Inside Deep Learning A-Z you will master some of the most cutting-edge Deep Learning algorithms and techniques (some of which didn't even exist a year ago) and through this course you will gain an immense amount of valuable hands-on experience with real-world business challenges. Plus, inside you will find inspiration to explore new Deep Learning skills and applications.&nbsp; &nbsp; </p><p><strong>---&nbsp;Real-World Case Studies ---</strong>\n\n&nbsp; </p><p>Mastering Deep Learning is not just about knowing the intuition and tools, it's also about being able to apply these models to real-world scenarios and derive actual measurable results for the business or project. That's why in this course we are introducing six exciting challenges:\n\n&nbsp; </p><p><strong>#1 Churn Modelling Problem</strong>\n\n&nbsp; </p><p>In this part you will be solving a data analytics challenge for a bank. You will be given a dataset with a large sample of the bank's customers. To make this dataset, the bank gathered information such as customer id, credit score, gender, age, tenure, balance, if the customer is active, has a credit card, etc. During a period of 6 months, the bank observed if these customers left or stayed in the bank.&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp; </p><p>Your goal is to make an Artificial Neural Network that can predict, based on geo-demographical and transactional information given above, if any individual customer will leave the bank or stay (customer churn). Besides, you are asked to rank all the customers of the bank, based on their probability of leaving. To do that, you will need to use the right Deep Learning model, one that is based on a probabilistic approach.&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp; </p><p>If you succeed in this project, you will create significant added value to the bank. By applying your Deep Learning model the bank may significantly reduce customer churn.\n\n&nbsp; </p><p><strong>#2 Image Recognition</strong>\n\n&nbsp; </p><p>In this part, you will create a Convolutional Neural Network that is able to detect various objects in images. We will implement this Deep Learning model to recognize a cat or a dog in a set of pictures. However, this model can be reused to detect anything else and we will show you how to do it - by simply changing the pictures in the input folder.&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp; </p><p>For example, you will be able to train the same model on a set of brain images, to detect if they contain a tumor or not. But if you want to keep it fitted to cats and dogs, then you will literally be able to a take a picture of your cat or your dog, and your model will predict which pet you have. We even tested it out on Hadelin’s dog!\n\n&nbsp; </p><p><strong>#3&nbsp;Stock Price Prediction</strong>\n\n&nbsp; </p><p>In this part, you will create one of the most powerful Deep Learning models. We will even go as far as saying that you will create the Deep Learning model closest to&nbsp;<em>“Artificial Intelligence”</em>. Why is that? Because this model will have long-term memory, just like us, humans.&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp; </p><p>The branch of Deep Learning which facilitates this is Recurrent Neural Networks. Classic RNNs have short memory, and were neither popular nor powerful for this exact reason. But a recent major improvement in Recurrent Neural Networks gave rise to the popularity of LSTMs (Long Short Term Memory RNNs) which has completely changed the playing field.&nbsp;We are extremely excited to include these cutting-edge deep learning methods in our course!&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp; </p><p>In this part you will learn how to implement this ultra-powerful model, and we will take the challenge to use it to predict the real Google stock price. A similar challenge has already been faced by researchers at Stanford University and we will aim to do at least as good as them.&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp; </p><p><strong>&nbsp;#4&nbsp;Fraud Detection</strong>\n\n&nbsp; </p><p>According to a recent report published by Markets &amp; Markets the Fraud Detection and Prevention Market is going to be worth $33.19 Billion USD by 2021. This is a huge industry and the demand for advanced Deep Learning skills is only going to grow. That’s why we have included this case study in the course. &nbsp;\n\n&nbsp; </p><p>This is the first part of Volume 2 - Unsupervised Deep Learning Models. The business challenge here is about detecting fraud in credit card applications. You will be creating a Deep Learning model for a bank and you are given a dataset that contains information on customers applying for an advanced credit card.&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp; </p><p>This is the data that customers provided when filling the application form. Your task is to detect potential fraud within these applications. That means that by the end of the challenge, you will literally come up with an explicit list of customers who potentially cheated on their applications.\n\n&nbsp; </p><p><strong>#5 &amp; 6 Recommender Systems</strong>\n\n&nbsp; </p><p>From Amazon product suggestions to Netflix movie recommendations - good recommender systems are very valuable in today's World. And specialists who can create them are some of the top-paid Data Scientists on the planet.\n\n&nbsp; </p><p>We will work on a dataset that has exactly the same features as the Netflix dataset: plenty of movies, thousands of users, who have rated the movies they watched. The ratings go from 1 to 5, exactly like in the Netflix dataset, which makes the Recommender System more complex to build than if the ratings were simply “Liked” or “Not Liked”.&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp; </p><p>Your final Recommender System will be able to predict the ratings of the movies the customers didn’t watch. Accordingly, by ranking the predictions from 5 down to 1, your Deep Learning model will be able to recommend which movies each user should watch. Creating such a powerful Recommender System is quite a challenge so we will give ourselves two shots. Meaning we will build it with two different Deep Learning models.\n\n&nbsp; </p><p>Our first model will be Deep Belief Networks, complex Boltzmann Machines that will be covered in Part 5. Then our second model will be with the powerful AutoEncoders, my personal favorites. You will appreciate the contrast between their simplicity, and what they are capable of.\n\n&nbsp; </p><p>And you will even be able to apply it to yourself or your friends. The list of movies will be explicit so you will simply need to rate the movies you already watched, input your ratings in the dataset, execute your model and voila! The Recommender System will tell you exactly which movies you would love one night you if are out of ideas of what to watch on Netflix! &nbsp;\n\n&nbsp; </p><p><strong>---&nbsp;Summary&nbsp;---</strong>\n\n&nbsp; </p><p>In conclusion, this is an exciting training program filled with intuition tutorials, practical exercises and real-World case studies.&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp; </p><p>We are super enthusiastic about Deep Learning and hope to see you inside the class!\n\n&nbsp; </p><p>Kirill &amp;&nbsp;Hadelin\n\n&nbsp; </p><p>\n\n</p>",

It's everything you want in an advanced CSS course, and more.</em></p><p>You will learn complex CSS animations, advanced responsive&nbsp;design techniques, flexbox layouts, Sass, CSS architecture, fundamental CSS concepts, and so much more.</p><p>Like in all my courses, you will build beautiful and carefully designed projects, that will make you proud of yourself and leave you ready to build complex projects on your own.</p><p>After finishing this course, you will:</p><p><strong>1)</strong>&nbsp;Be up to speed with the most modern and advanced CSS properties and techniques;</p><p><strong>2)</strong>&nbsp;Have mastered the cutting-edge layout technologies Flexbox and CSS Grid;</p><p><strong>3)</strong>&nbsp;Be ready to build responsive layouts for all kinds of devices and situations;</p><p><strong>4)</strong>&nbsp;Truly understand how CSS&nbsp;works behind the scenes;</p><p><strong>5)</strong>&nbsp;Be able to architect large CSS codebases for reusability and maintainability using Sass.</p><p>Please note that this course is <strong>NOT</strong> for absolute beginners, so you should already be at an intermediate level in HTML and CSS&nbsp;(please&nbsp;check out my other course if that's not the case).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>This course is massive, coming in at 28+ hours. Here is exactly what you will learn:</strong></p><ul><li><p><em>Tons of modern cutting-edge CSS techniques to create stunning designs and effects:</em> clip-path, background-clip, mask-image, background-blend-mode, shape-outside, filter, backdrop-filter, object-fit, transform, column-count, hyphens, perspective, calc() and custom CSS properties;</p></li><li><p><em>Advanced CSS animations</em> with @keyframes, animation, and transition;</p></li><li><p><em>Advanced CSS selectors, pseudo-classes, and pseudo-elements</em> required for modern CSS development;</p></li><li><p><em>How CSS works behind the scenes:</em> the cascade, specificity, inheritance, value processing, the visual formatting model, the box model, box types, positioning schemes, and stacking contexts;</p></li><li><p><em>CSS architecture:</em> The 7-1 rule, component-based design, the BEM methodology, writing reusable, maintainable, and scalable code;</p></li><li><p><em>Introduction to Sass:</em> variables, nesting, partials, imports, mixins, functions, extends, and more;</p></li><li><p><em>Using Sass in real-world projects:</em> setting global variables, building for reusability, architecting CSS, and managing media queries;</p></li><li><p><em>The NPM ecosystem:</em> setting up a development process to compile Sass and automatic browser reload, and creating a build process to concatenate, prefix, and compress CSS files;</p></li><li><p><em>Modern responsive design:</em> fluid grids, layout types, flexible images, using media queries to test for different screen widths, pixel densities, and touch capabilities;</p></li><li><p><em>Advanced responsive design workflows:</em> mobile-first vs desktop-first strategies, selecting breakpoints, em vs rem units and feature queries to test for browser support;</p></li><li><p><em>Responsive images in HTML and CSS for faster pageloads:</em> resolution switching, density switching, art direction;</p></li><li><p><em>SVG images in HTML and CSS:</em> how and why to use SVG, generating SVG sprites, changing SVG colors in CSS and best practices;</p></li><li><p><em>Videos in HTML and CSS:</em> building a background video effect;</p></li><li><p><em>Flexbox layouts:</em> main concepts, introduction to both flex container and flex item-specific properties, advanced positioning techniques applied to a huge real-world project;</p></li><li><p><em>CSS Grid layouts</em>: main concepts, CSS grid vs flexbox, and layout techniques applied to a real-world project. This part alone could be an entire course!</p></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Why should you take this course?</strong></p><p>So you saw that the course is absolutely full-packed with content. But maybe you're still not sure if you should actually learn advanced CSS?</p><p>That's probably because CSS is so easy to get started with. In fact, most developers highly underestimate the importance and power of CSS. But nothing could be further away from the truth!</p><p>CSS is what makes our design come to life. And there is so much we can do with it! Mastering advanced techniques like flexbox, CSS grid, and animations, will give you an edge over many CSS developers out there who still use outdated methods.</p><p>Plus, CSS can become a real nightmare when you try to master it, and when you&nbsp;have to maintain large projects. So having a good grasp on fundamental concepts is an absolute must for any serious front-end developer.</p><p>And this course will help you with all&nbsp;that!</p><p><em>So, should you take this course? The answer is most likely a big YES!</em></p><p>And I packed so much content into this course, that no matter if you're just starting out, or if you're already an experienced front-end developer, there is definitely gonna be something for you in this course.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>And this is what you get by signing up today:</strong></p><ul><li><p>28h of Up-to-date HD-quality videos, that are easy to search and reference (great for Udemy Business students)</p></li><li><p>Professional English captions (not the&nbsp;auto-generated ones)</p></li><li><p>Downloadable design assets + starter code and final code for each section</p></li><li><p>Downloadable slides for theory videos (not boring, I promise!)</p></li><li><p>Free support in the course Q&amp;A</p></li><li><p>Lots of small challenges are included in the videos so you can track your progress.</p></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you're still with me at this point, then please watch the promo video to take a look at the course projects, and I promise you will be amazed :)</p><p><strong>After that, I hope to welcome you as a new student in my course.

You'll learn practical techniques to harness the power of AI for various professional applications, from generating text and images to enhancing software development and boosting your creative projects.</p><p><strong><em>! Warning !:</em></strong><em> The majority of our lessons require reading and modifying code in Python (for each lesson marked with \"- Coding\" in the title). Please don't buy this course if you can't code and aren't seriously dedicated to learning technical skills. We've heard from non-technical people they still got value from seeing what's possible, but please don't complain in the reviews ;-)</em></p><p>The number of papers published on AI every month is growing exponentially, and it’s becoming increasingly difficult to keep up.

Mike also has courses on LinkedIn; together with James, they are running Vexpower. The price is low to collect reviews. It will go up, for sure. GET\" – Periklis Papanikolaou</p></li><li><p>\"This course is a legit practical course for prompt engineering, I learned a lot from this course. The resources that they provided is good, but some of the course (tagged with 'Coding' in the Course Title) is for intermediate or advance people in Python programming. If you are not usual with Python, this will be a challenge (like me), but we can overcome it because they taught us step by step pretty clearly (of course I need to pause or backwards). Thanks for this course, but you guys can provide more real case scenario when using AI (less/without coding maybe...)\" – J Arnold Parlindungan Gultom</p></li></ul><p>So why wait?

Most companies today realize that the practices of continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) will yield tremendous benefits like increased business revenue and faster time-to-market. The demand for these skills has been steadily rising over the last few years.</p><p><br></p><p>There are a plethora of tools available in the CI/CD/DevOps landscape today. Implementing continuous integration, continuous delivery and continuous deployment with these tools and frameworks can help us immensely in modernizing our software development lifecycle. It catches us bugs early and increases the quality of our software products. This, in turn, reduces the overall cost for software development in startups and enterprise alike.</p><p><br></p><p>But before getting into tools and frameworks, it is important that you get a holistic picture of CI / CD and DevOps. For this, you need to understand where we started from - the old school traditional software development cycle. We will pick holes in the old model, identify pain points and learn how CI / CD and DevOps evolved, one step at a time. Once you build a rock solid foundation using this course, you can move on to more specific tool oriented courses.</p><p><br></p><p>If you are thinking about moving on to CI/CD/DevOps from your old school software development model, this course is for you. Well illustrated with animations to help you grasp a clear understanding of the underlying principles. Once you complete this course, you can take on bigger challenges related to implementation. </p><p><br></p><p>The demand for professionals who have experience with CI/CD/DevOps has been growing steadily over the last few years. The salaries for these skills have gone through the roof and are only bound to go up as the demand for these skills increases. Professionals with CI / CD / DevOps skill set can demand as much as $150K as their yearly compensation as per latest US job and salary surveys. And this is where you start!</p>",

Once you complete the course, you will get <strong>3 extra AIs</strong>: <strong>DDPG</strong>, <strong>Full World Model</strong>, and <strong>Evolution Strategies &amp; Genetic Algorithms</strong>. We build these AIs with ChatGPT for a Self-Driving Car and a Humanoid application. For each of these extra AIs you will get a long video lecture explaining the implementation, a mini PDF, and the Python code.</p><p><br></p><p>Besides, you will get a <strong>free 3-hour extra course on Generative AI and LLMs with Cloud Computing</strong> as a Prize for completing the course.</p><p><br></p><p>And last but not least, here is what you will get with this course:</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Complete beginner to expert AI skills&nbsp;–</strong> Learn to code self-improving AI for a range of purposes. In fact, we code together with you. Every tutorial starts with a blank page and we write up the code from scratch. This way you can follow along and understand exactly how the code comes together and what each line means.</p><p><strong>2. Hassle-Free Coding and Code templates –&nbsp;</strong>We will build all our AIs in Google Colab, which means that we will have absolutely NO hassle installing libraries or packages because everything is already pre-installed in Google Colab notebooks. Plus, you’ll get downloadable Python code templates (in .py and .ipynb) for every AI you build in the course. This makes building truly unique AI as simple as changing a few lines of code. If you unleash your imagination, the potential is unlimited.</p><p><strong>3. Intuition Tutorials –</strong>&nbsp;Where most courses simply bombard you with dense theory and set you on your way, we believe in developing a deep understanding for not only what you’re doing, but why you’re doing it. That’s why we don’t throw complex mathematics at you, but focus on building up your intuition in AI for much better results down the line.</p><p><strong>4. Real-world solutions –</strong>&nbsp;You’ll achieve your goal in not only one AI model but in 5. Each module is comprised of varying structures and difficulties, meaning you’ll be skilled enough to build AI adaptable to any environment in real life, rather than just passing a glorified memory “test and forget” like most other courses. Practice truly does make perfect.</p><p><strong>5. In-course support –</strong>&nbsp;We’re fully committed to making this the most accessible and results-driven AI course on the planet. This requires us to be there when you need our help. That’s why we’ve put together a team of professional Data Scientists to support you in your journey, meaning you’ll get a response from us within 48 hours maximum.</p><p><br></p><p>So, are you ready to embrace the fascinating world of AI?</p><p>Come join us, never stop learning, and enjoy AI!</p>",

            "description": "<p><strong>WHAT IS JAVASCRIPT? </strong></p><p>JavaScript is one of the most popular programming languages in the world, and growing faster than any other programming language. As a developer, you can use JavaScript to <strong>build web and mobile apps, real-time networking apps, command-line tools, and games</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><br></p><p><strong>4 REASONS TO LEARN JAVASCRIPT </strong></p>\n\n<ul><li>JavaScript is a key tool for front-end, back-end, and full-stack developers.</li><li>The average annual salary for a JavaScript developer is<strong> $72,000.</strong></li><li><strong></strong>Companies like Walmart, Netflix, and PayPal run big internal applications around JavaScript.</li><li>Having strong JavaScript knowledge will help you land your dream job.</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>A STEP-BY-STEP, BEGINNER-FRIENDLY COURSE</strong></p><p>This course is your first step towards a new career in web or mobile development. Here is what you get when enroll in this course: </p>\n\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n\n<ul><li><strong>6 hours </strong>of HD videos</li><li><strong>Bite-sized and easy-to-digest videos with \"no fluff”</strong> </li><li><strong>30 exercises</strong> and challenges with solutions</li><li><strong>Expert tips</strong> to become a JavaScript wizard</li><li><strong>No more wasted time</strong> on disconnected, out-of-date tutorials</li><li><strong>Learn at your own pace </strong>- take your time if required</li><li><strong>Unlimited access</strong> - watch the course as many times as you wish</li><li><strong>30-day money-back guarantee </strong>- try it risk free! You have nothing to lose. </li><li><strong>Certificate of completion</strong> to present to your current or future employer</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><br></p><p><strong>WHY THIS COURSE?</strong></p><p>There are several JavaScript courses on Udemy. So, what makes this course different? Here are 5 reasons: </p><ul><li><strong>Taught by a senior coder and best-selling instructor</strong> - Mosh Hamedani </li><li>Mosh has <strong>17 years of experience</strong> as a software engineer</li><li>He has produced <strong>19 courses</strong> and many of them are <strong>best-selling</strong> courses </li><li>He has taught over<strong> 200,000 students </strong>in 192 countries </li><li><strong>No fluff or unnecessary repetition</strong> - don't waste your time on long courses </li><li><strong>Clear, concise, and practical training </strong>- start coding right away </li><li><strong>Learn how to think like a programmer </strong>- most, if not all, courses just teach you JavaScript features, not the art of problem solving </li><li><strong>JavaScript interview questions </strong>- many of the exercises in the course are picked from popular interview questions </li><li><strong>Fun and engaging </strong>- just read Mosh's reviews and see what his students have to say</li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>WHO IS THIS COURSE FOR? </strong></p><ul><li><strong>Aspiring developers</strong> - perhaps you learned a little bit of HTML and CSS and want to take your first JavaScript programming course. This course is an ideal starting point.  </li><li><strong>Experienced developers with no degree in computer science</strong> - there are a lot of self-taught web developers out there who cannot solve basic programming problems, because they never attended a college. Don't be one of those! This course teaches you the fundamental programming skills that every developer must know. </li><li><strong>Anyone who wants to better understand JavaScript</strong> - chances are you've taken another course but didn't understand certain topics well. You can take this course to fill the gaps and strengthen your understanding of JavaScript. </li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>NO PRIOR KNOWLEDGE NEEDED</strong><strong></strong></p>\n\n<p>You don't need familiarity with JavaScript to take this course. You'll learn everything from scratch, step-by-step. A very basic familiarity with HTML will be helpful but it is not required.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong></strong><br></p><p><strong></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>ARE YOU READY TO MAKE THE FIRST STEP TOWARDS BECOMING A WEB OR MOBILE DEVELOPER?</strong></p><p>Stop wasting your time on disconnected tutorials or super long courses. Enroll in the course to get started. With a 30-day money-back guarantee, what do you have to lose? </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><br><strong></strong></p>",

Join a live online community of over 900,000+ developers and a course taught by an industry expert that has actually worked both in Silicon Valley and Toronto as a senior developer. Graduates of this course are now working at Google, Tesla, Amazon, Apple, IBM, JP Morgan, Meta + other top tech companies.</strong></p><p>Want to land a job at a great tech company like Google, Microsoft, Meta, Netflix, Amazon, or other companies but you are intimidated by the interview process and the coding questions? Do you find yourself feeling like you get \"stuck\" every time you get asked a coding question? This course is your answer. Using the strategies, lessons, and exercises in this course, you will learn how to land offers from all sorts of companies. </p><p>Many developers who are \"self taught\", feel that one of the main disadvantages they face compared to college educated graduates in computer science is the fact that they don't have knowledge about algorithms, data structures and the notorious Big-O Notation. Get on the same level as someone with computer science degree by learning the fundamental building blocks of computer science which will give you a big boost during interviews. <strong>You will also get access to our private online chat community with thousands of developers online to help you get through the course.<br><br></strong>Here is what you will learn in this course:</p><p><strong>Technical:</strong></p><p><strong>1. Big O notation<br><br>2. Data structures: <br><br>* Arrays<br>* Hash Tables<br>* Singly Linked Lists<br>* Doubly Linked Lists<br>* Queues<br>* Stacks<br>* Trees (BST, AVL&nbsp;Trees, Red Black Trees, Binary Heaps)<br>* Tries<br>* Graphs<br><br>3. Algorithms: <br><br>* Recursion<br>* Sorting<br>* Searching<br>* Tree Traversal<br>* Breadth First Search<br>* Depth First Search<br>* Dynamic Programming<br><br>Non Technical:</strong></p><p><strong>- How to get more interviews<br>- What to do during interviews<br>- What do do after the interview<br>- How to answer interview questions<br>- How to handle offers<br>- How to negotiate your salary<br>- How to get a raise</strong></p><p>Unlike most instructors, I am not a marketer or a salesperson. I am a senior developer and programmer who has worked and managed teams of engineers and have been in these interviews both as an interviewee as well as the interviewer.<br><br>My job as an instructor will be successful if I am able to help you become better at interviewing and land more jobs. This one skill can really change the course of your career and I hope you sign up today to see what it can do for your career!</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Taught by: </strong><br> </p><p>Andrei is the instructor of the <strong>highest rated&nbsp;Web Development course on Udemy as well as&nbsp;one of the fastest&nbsp;growing.&nbsp;</strong>His graduates have&nbsp;moved&nbsp;on to work for&nbsp;some of the biggest tech&nbsp;companies around the world like Apple, Google, JP Morgan, IBM, etc...&nbsp;He&nbsp;has&nbsp;been working as a senior software developer in&nbsp;Silicon Valley and Toronto for many years,&nbsp;and&nbsp;is now taking all that he has learned,&nbsp;to teach&nbsp;programming skills and&nbsp;to help you&nbsp;discover the amazing career opportunities that being a developer allows in&nbsp;life.&nbsp;</p><p>Having been&nbsp;a self taught programmer,&nbsp;he understands that there is an&nbsp;overwhelming number of online courses, tutorials and books&nbsp;that are overly verbose and inadequate at teaching proper skills.&nbsp;Most people feel paralyzed and don't know where to start when learning a complex subject matter, or even worse, most people don't have $20,000 to spend on a coding bootcamp.&nbsp;<strong>Programming skills should be affordable and open to all. An education material&nbsp;should teach real life skills that are current and&nbsp;they should not waste a student's valuable time.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Having learned important&nbsp;lessons from working for Fortune 500 companies, tech startups, to even&nbsp;founding his own business, he is now dedicating 100% of his time to&nbsp;teaching others valuable&nbsp;software development skills&nbsp;in order to take control of their life and work in an exciting industry with infinite possibilities.&nbsp;</p><p>Andrei promises you that there are no other courses out there as comprehensive and as well explained.&nbsp;<strong>He believes that in order to learn anything of value, you need to start with the foundation and develop the roots of the tree. Only from there will you be able to learn concepts and specific skills(leaves) that connect to the foundation. Learning becomes exponential when structured in this way.</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Taking his experience in educational psychology and coding, Andrei's courses will take you on an understanding of complex subjects that you never thought would be possible.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><p><strong>See you inside the courses!</strong></p><p><br></p>",

They introduce you to a few concepts here and there, but soon you'll find yourself jumping from one tutorial to another to fill the missing gaps. By taking a perfectly-structured course, you'll be confident that you're in good hands, right from the beginning all the way through to the very end. You pay for saving your precious time: the time that you can spend on the things you love. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, many of these free tutorials, including tutorials published by Microsoft on the official ASP.NET website, teach you poor practices. Throughout this course, Mosh points out some of these poor practices and explains in technical terms why you should avoid them. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n<p><strong>WHAT OTHER STUDENTS WHO HAVE TAKEN THIS COURSE SAY</strong></p>\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n<p>\"The is course is very much worth your time and money. Mosh did an outstanding job explaining each aspect of MVC 5 as well as introducing and using other technologies such as Web API. I've been working with MVC since it's release but felt I needed a refresher course and this was excellent. I would also recommend it to developers just getting into MVC as well because Mosh does a great job of explaining the concepts behind what you're learning. I really enjoyed it and highly recommend it.\" -Scott Smith<br></p>\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n<p>\"Course teaches exactly what the title promises to teach. Quality of production, content, and lectures are excellent! Explanations of the how and why are also a nice touch!\" -Pierre Gadea</p>\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n<p>\"Mosh never disappoints. Clear explanations. Exercises that will test you knowledge. Great instruction as always. I also love that he includes shortcuts and best practices. Worth the time and money!\" -Lara Caves</p>\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n<p>\"Amazing course from Mosh! After I finished the C# series, I moved directly to this course and learn so much and even developed a successful web app in my internship! Thanks Mosh for a great course!!\" -Menny Atia</p>\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n<p>\"I've been into web development for more than 15 years, but until recently I was totally new to ASP.NET MVC. Before taking this course I tried other courses, but these were either too complicated for a beginner or didn't cover all the necessery informations needed to get started. This is an excellent course to begin with ASP.NET MVC that covers everything you need to create a real world project. The prerequisites are a good understaning of C# (OOP, Lambdas, LINQ...) , Javascript and JQuery\" -Marko Pavic</p>\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n<p>\"Professionally structured, carefully planned course. Passionate, engaging instructor with great communication skills. Best course I've ever had on Udemy so far. I would love to take the follow-up course on architecture and testing mentioned in the final video.\" -Istvan Voros</p>\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n<p>\"One of the best courses i have ever taken,Recommend for every C# developer through his all the courses in Udemy. They are eye-openers and it will change the way you think about Programming.After taking his courses ,with in a span of one month i have a cracked a interview in one of the Big 4 with 70% hike.\" -Rama Reddy</p>\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>30-DAY FULL MONEY-BACK GUARANTEE</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>This course comes with a 30-day full money-back guarantee.

You will even learn how to write unit tests for algorithms. We go into how JavaScript works under the hood including execution context, the call stack, event loop, etc. We learn about Webpack tooling and how to create a modern development environment. At the end, we build a Node.js/Express API with a custom Webpack frontend.</p><p><br></p><p>All of the code in the learning modules will go into a folder called \"JavaScript Sandbox\". This is so we can keep things organized and you can always refer back to it for any code snippets that you may need.

We start off by signing up for GitHub, creating a repository there, the makiing  a local copy (clone), local changes (add/commit) and then update GitHub with our changes (push).  </p>\n\n<p>  \t               In <strong>Basic Commands</strong>, we walk through all the foundational commands needed to start a new project managed by Git (or enable    Git for an existing project)     all the way through making commits, including common file operations like moving and deleting files.    We also cover how to exclude the wrong files from accidentally being committed and how to review your repository's history.  </p>\n\n<p>  \t              With a strong foundation in place, we explore ways to make <strong>Comparisons</strong> in Git, including all the different local states, between commits,   and between local and remote repositories.  </p>\n\n<p>  \t              We give great attending to <strong>Branching and Merging</strong> in Git. We start off with the simple \"happy path\" and learn about \"Fast-Forward\" merges   and how to control them. The we walk through common \"automatic\" merges. Finally, we cause trouble on purpose so we can step through   resolving conflicting merges with our visual merge tool.  </p>\n\n<p>  \t  With a strong foundation in branching and merging, we will then cover a more complex topic, <strong>Rebasing</strong>. In that section, we cover several rebasing examples, including how to resolve a rebase conflict.  </p>\n\n<p>  \tIn the <strong>Stashing</strong> section, we save our work-in-progress while we attend to more pressing issues, then pick up where we left off after that.  </p>\n\n<p><em><strong>NEW:</strong></em> In the <strong>Tagging </strong>section, we mark important milestones or releases within our project. We also use those tags later for comparing differences between important milestones. We also look at how to use tags within GitHub.</p>\n\n<p>  \t<strong>All tools</strong> have <em>installation </em>and <em>configuration </em>sections to ensure no one is left behind.  </p>\n\n<p> <strong>Course Features</strong> <br></p><p>  \t<strong>Presentations</strong> provide audio/video training of conceptual ideas. Since few like slide-ware presentations, slide-presentations are kept to a minimum.  </p>\n\n<p>  \t<strong>Screencasts</strong> provide a video of the instructor's computer system with any actions, commands, or screens displayed and narrated.   There is nearly 4 hours of screencast based video training in order to step through each command or action in sufficient detail.  </p>\n\n<p>  \t                       Several <strong>attachments</strong> and <strong>document </strong>lectures throughout the course provide supplemental information, illustrations, or other reference material.  </p>\n\n<p>  \t<strong>Moving Forward</strong>  </p>\n\n<p>  \t  This course will expand periodically to include more topics, supporting materials and bonus content!

            "description": "<p>The following sentence is annoying, but also true: <strong>the best time to learn Git was yesterday</strong>. Fortunately, the second best time is today!&nbsp; Git is an essential tool for work in any code-related field, from data science to game development to machine learning.&nbsp; This course covers everything you need to know to start using Git and Github in the real-world today!</p><p>The course's 20+ sections are broken down into four separate units:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Git Essentials </strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Next Level Git</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Github &amp; Collaboration</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>The Tricky Bits</strong></p></li></ul><p>We start off with <strong>Git Essentials.</strong>&nbsp; The goal of this unit is to give you all the essential Git tools you need for daily use.&nbsp; We start off talking about version control software, what it is, why it matters, and the history of Git.&nbsp; Then we install Git and run through the Unix commands you'll need to work with Git (you can skip this if you're already familiar).&nbsp; The bulk of this unit is focused on teaching the core Git mechanics like <strong>committing </strong>and <strong>branching</strong> and the associated concepts: the working directory, the repository, the staging area, etc.&nbsp; &nbsp; We cover Git commands including: git init, git add, git commit, git status, git log, git branch, and git merge.&nbsp; We end with a detailed look at branching, <strong>merging</strong>, and <strong>resolving conflicts</strong>. </p><p>Then we move on to out <strong>Next Level Git </strong>unit, where we cover additional commands and Git concepts that are extremely useful, but maybe not as \"core\" as the Git Essentials.&nbsp; We start with a comprehensive look at the <strong>gif diff</strong> command and the various comparisons that we can make between commits, branches, the working directory, the staging area, and more!&nbsp; We pay special attention to reading and parsing the dense output generated by diffs.&nbsp; Then we shift our focus to stashing with the <strong>git stash </strong>command, a \"convenience command\" that many users love incorporating into their Git workflow.&nbsp; Finally, we dive deep into <strong>undoing changes and time traveling</strong> with Git.&nbsp; We learn how to revisit earlier work, detach and re-attach HEAD, and discard changes.&nbsp; We cover git commands that help us undo changes including <strong>git checkout</strong>, <strong>git restore</strong>, <strong>git reset</strong>, and <strong>git revert</strong>.</p><p>Next up, we change gears to focus on <strong>Github &amp; Collaboration</strong>.&nbsp; We start by exploring Github (and similar tools) that host remote repositories and discussing the benefits they provide.&nbsp; We create our own Github repositories and sync up changes between our remote and local repositories using the <strong>git push</strong>, <strong>git pull</strong>, and <strong>git fetch</strong> commands.&nbsp; We then focus on commonly used <strong>collaboration workflows</strong> that students may encounter in the real world: <strong>feature branching</strong>, <strong>pull requests</strong>, <strong>forking &amp; cloning</strong>, and more! We discuss <strong>contributing to open source </strong>projects and configuring Github repositories for collaboration. We also spend some time learning about useful Github features including Github <strong>Gists </strong>and <strong>Github Pages</strong> for free static hosting.</p><p>The last unit in the course, <strong>The Tricky Bits</strong>, is really just a collection of useful Git command and advanced topics.&nbsp; We start by covering one of the \"scarier\" Git commands: <strong>rebasing</strong>!&nbsp; We discuss the potential benefits and pitfalls of rebasing and compare it to merging.&nbsp; Then we learn how to clean up our Git history by rewording, editing, dropping, and <strong>squashing</strong> commits using the <strong>interactive rebase</strong> command.&nbsp; Next, we discuss <strong>Git tags</strong> (lightweight and <strong>annotated tags</strong>) semantic versioning and tagging workflows.&nbsp; After that, we move on to a deep dive into the inner workings of Git.&nbsp; We discuss the files and folders Git uses internally, the role of <strong>hashing</strong> functions in Git, and the role of Git objects (<strong>blobs</strong>, <strong>trees</strong>, etc.). Next, we talk about reference logs and the <strong>git reflog</strong> command.&nbsp; Specifically, we learn how we can use reflogs to rescue \"lost\" commits and <strong>undo rebases</strong>.&nbsp; Finally, we learn how to write custom and powerful <strong>Git aliases</strong>!</p><p>Throughout the course, you'll find tons and tons of diagrams and visual references I've created to try and explain Git.&nbsp; The course also includes exercises I've tested on my in-person students, to give you an opportunity to practice the concepts in the course along the way.&nbsp; If you are reading this sentence, I congratulate you on making it this far :) I&nbsp;hope you enjoy the course!</p>",

It's both a <strong>complete guide</strong>, starting with the core basics of the language, as well as an <strong>extensive reference</strong> of the JavaScript language and environment, ensuring that both newcomers as well as experienced JavaScript developers get a lot out of this course!</p><p>It's a <strong>huge course packed with important knowledge</strong> and helpful content:</p><p>From the core basics, over advanced concepts and JavaScript specialties, all the way up to expert topics like performance optimization and testing - this course has it all. My goal was to create your go-to resource for the JavaScript language, which you can not just use for learning it but also as a resource you can come back to and look up important topics.</p><p>The course is based on my experience as a long-term JavaScript developer as well as a teacher with <strong>more than 2,500,000 students </strong>on Udemy as well as on my YouTube channel Academind. It's<strong> packed with examples, demos, projects, assignments, quizzes</strong> and of course videos - all with the goal of giving you the best possible way of learning JavaScript.</p><p><strong>What's in the course?</strong></p><p>This course is obviously packed with content - I&nbsp;therefore strongly recommend that you check out the full course curriculum to get a clear idea of all the topics covered in the course. In general, here's what you'll find in the course:</p><ul><li><p>Modern JavaScript from the start:&nbsp;The JavaScript syntax changed over time - in this course, you'll learn the<strong> latest syntax from the start </strong>(you'll also learn about the old one though, so that you can work in ANY&nbsp;JS&nbsp;project)</p></li><li><p>ALL&nbsp;the Basics:&nbsp;Variables, constants, functions, how scripts are loaded etc</p></li><li><p>Arrays &amp;&nbsp;Objects:&nbsp;We'll explore these very important data structures in great detail</p></li><li><p>Control Structures:&nbsp;Understand how to run code conditionally and in loops</p></li><li><p>A&nbsp;look behind the Scenes: How JavaScript engines work behind the scenes and what that means for us</p></li><li><p><strong>Deep dives into Core Concepts</strong>:&nbsp;ALL&nbsp;the special things about JavaScript function, different syntaxes</p></li><li><p>Working with the DOM:&nbsp;How to manipulate web pages dynamically via JavaScript (including deep dives and different use-cases)</p></li><li><p>Events in JavaScript:&nbsp;Learn how to listen to a broad variety of events (e.g. drag &amp;&nbsp;drop) and execute appropriate code</p></li><li><p>Classes &amp;&nbsp;<strong>Object-oriented Programming</strong>:&nbsp;Learn how to work with classes, prototypes, the \"<strong>this</strong>\"&nbsp;keyword, constructor functions and much more</p></li><li><p><strong>Asynchronous</strong> and Synchronous Programming:&nbsp;We'll explore callbacks, promises, async/&nbsp;await and other important tools and language features to execute code correctly</p></li><li><p>Http Requests:&nbsp;Learn how to send Http requests via JavaScript</p></li><li><p>Tooling, Optimizations &amp;&nbsp;Browser Support:&nbsp;Code splitting, producing small code and ensuring that scripts work in all browsers&nbsp; - this matters and hence is covered in great detail</p></li><li><p>Libraries &amp;&nbsp;Frameworks:&nbsp;Learn about libraries like Axios or frameworks like <strong>React.js</strong> - why they matter and how to use them</p></li><li><p><strong>Node.js</strong>:&nbsp;Whilst focusing on the browser-side for the majority of the course (because the syntax is the same), we'll also have a dedicated section on Node.js to learn all about that JS host environment</p></li><li><p>Security &amp;&nbsp;Performance Optimizations:&nbsp;Of course security matters, so does performance - no surprise that both is covered in the course!</p></li><li><p><strong>Automated Testing</strong>:&nbsp;Testing manually is hard work and can be unreliable - in this course you'll also get an introduction into automated testing</p></li></ul><p><strong>What are the course prerequisites?</strong></p><ul><li><p>NO&nbsp;JavaScript knowledge is required - you'll learn it from scratch!</p></li><li><p>You also need NO&nbsp;programming experience other than basic web development knowledge (e.g. how the web works)</p></li><li><p>Basic HTML and CSS knowledge is recommended but not a must-have</p></li></ul>",

You'll learn how to structure your code for reuse and to be easier to understand, manage, and expand using <strong>modules and understand how modules really work</strong>.</p><p>You'll learn <strong>how asynchronous code works in Node and the Node event loop</strong>, as well as how to use the <strong>event emitter, streams, buffers, pipes, and work with files</strong>. We'll see how that leads to <strong>building a web server in Node</strong>. </p><p>We'll dive into<strong> web sites, web apps and APIs with Express</strong> and learn how Express can save us time as Node developers.</p><p>You'll also gain an understanding of <strong>npm, connecting to databases, and the MEAN stack</strong>!</p><p>During it all you'll gain a deep understanding of the Javascript concepts and other computer science concepts that power Node.</p><p>NodeJS doesn't have to be hard to learn. The biggest mistake most coding tutorials make is expecting someone to learn simply by imitating others' code. Real world situations are never exactly like the tutorial.</p><p>I believe the best way to learn is to understand how a tool works and what it does for you, look at examples, and then try it yourself. That's how this course is built, with the goal to help you both learn and understand NodeJS.</p><p><em>Note: In this course you'll also get </em><strong><em>downloadable source code</em></strong><em>.

In my first year teaching online, I was selected as the <strong>Best Newcomer Instructor in the&nbsp;Udemy Instructor Awards 2015</strong>.&nbsp; I'm passionate about making the best possible online learning experiences that mirror my in-person courses.</p><p><strong>If you want to take ONE COURSE to master Python&nbsp;take this course.</strong><br></p>",

Especially if you're going for a job interview or have a Java Project that needs your best performance. This course assumes no prior java experience so&nbsp;&nbsp;prior Java so&nbsp;it will take you from zero to hero!</p><p>The topics covered include Object Orientation which I think is not stressed enough in other Java courses so I've got special focus on that throughout the lectures. You'll get plenty of practice writing classes and interfaces as well as&nbsp;countless&nbsp;methods with loops and if else statements,<strong> exception handling and file processing</strong> as well as how to&nbsp;<strong>debug&nbsp;software using Eclipse</strong>. You'll also be mastering the <strong>collections framework</strong> and diving deep into <strong>java generics</strong>. You'll learn all there is to know about <strong>multi-threading</strong> and the <strong>JDBC API</strong> for working with a <strong>MySQL database</strong>. There are also<strong> practical projects</strong> scattered throughout the course so that you can practice the concepts as you learn them. For example one of the projects is related to a car dealership management system and another assignment involves processing files with stock market data. So as you can see, I tried to keep the projects professional and industry relevant rather than cloning a game like flappy bird.</p><p>I want this course to be the ultimate go-to resource for anyone that's looking to become a core Java programmer so I intend on adding more content to this course based on new technologies and student feedback. The content is Java 9 ready which means I'll show you how to upgrade to the latest version of Java which is version 9 and I'll teach you how to configure Eclipse to work with both Java 8 as well as version 9.<br></p><p><strong>Don’t just take it from me, take it from other students that have taken this course.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>★★★★★ <strong>Here’s reviews from real students that took this course</strong> ★★★★★</p><p><br></p><p>★★★★★ Instructions are very clear and easy to follow. <strong>I know nothing about java and so far I’m keeping up just fine.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>★★★★★ <strong>Easy to understand the difficult topics as well</strong>. Overall nice course. Learnt the basic java concepts very well and also collections framework and JDBC topics are also very nicely explained.</p><p><br></p><p>★★★★★ The explanation of each concept is done very well. This is a <strong>great course for beginners</strong>.</p><p><br>★★★★★ This course is awesome! <strong>The teacher is very thorough with his explanations</strong> of the theory and application. I'm really enjoying it!</p><p><br>★★★★★ Yes it is for sure the best!! As it <strong>covers all the topic from basic to advanced topics in java.</strong></p><p><br>★★★★★ I am taking my second semester of Java programming at university. I signed up for this course to augment my university studies. I learn more from this one course with a better understanding of programming principles than I have learned at university.The university gives me college credit; <strong>this course will get me a job!</strong></p><p><br></p><p>★★★★★ I'm taking a class about object-oriented programming in relation to Java. However, the reading material uses quite a bit of technical lengthy jargon that I simply get confused. This class has been extremely helpful in presenting concepts in a straightforward and simple way. I can understand what he's explaining and it makes sense. <strong>This is a fantastic course and I'd recommend it to anyone who is feeling discouraged about learning about object-oriented programming</strong>.</p><p><br>★★★★★ Congratulations – <strong>the instructor has turned complicated topics into easy interactive components</strong>. High praises to the instructor are in order. The instructor was very knowledgeable, worked at a good pace, and most importantly, was very good at communicating.<br></p><p>Topics covered in this course:</p><ul><li><p><em>Variables</em></p></li><li><p><em>Data Types</em></p></li><li><p><em>Arrays</em></p></li><li><p><em>Control Flow</em></p></li><li><p><em>Methods</em></p></li><li><p><em>Classes</em></p></li><li><p><em>Objects</em></p></li><li><p><em>Program Flow</em></p></li><li><p><em>Class Inheritance</em></p></li><li><p><em>Interfaces</em></p></li><li><p><em>Abstract Classes</em></p></li><li><p><em>Strings</em></p></li><li><p><em>While &amp; For Loops</em></p></li><li><p><em>Nested For Loops</em></p></li><li><p><em>Debugger</em></p></li><li><p><em>Building and Deploying Java Programs with JAR Files</em></p></li><li><p><em>File Processing</em></p></li><li><p><em>Collections Framework</em></p></li><li><p><em>Collection Methods</em></p></li><li><p><em>Hashcode, HashMap, LinkedHashMap and TreeMap</em></p></li><li><p><em>Java Generics</em></p></li><li><p><em>Threading</em></p></li><li><p><em>Java JDBC</em></p></li><li><p><em>JShell</em></p></li><li><p><em>Lambda Expressions</em></p></li><li><p><em>Streams API</em></p></li></ul><p><br></p><p>I'm confident that you'll enjoy this course at-least as much if not more than my other popular Java courses, but as always you've got a 30 day money back guarantee no questions asked!&nbsp;Check out the preview lectures and join today!<br></p>",

            "description": "<p><strong>Just FULLY updated and re-recorded with all new React features (React v18)! Join a live online community of over 900,000+ developers and a course taught by industry experts that have actually worked both in Silicon Valley and Toronto with React.js.</strong> <br><br>Using the latest version of React <em>(React 18)</em>, this course is focused on efficiency. Never spend time on confusing, out of date, incomplete tutorials anymore. <strong>Graduates of Andrei’s courses are now working at Google, Tesla, Amazon, Apple, IBM, JP Morgan, Meta, + other top tech companies.</strong></p><p>We guarantee you this is the most comprehensive online resource on React. This project based course will introduce you to all of the modern toolchain of a React developer. Along the way, we will build a massive e-commerce application similar to Shopify using React, Redux, React Hooks, React Suspense, React Router, GraphQL, Context API, Firebase, Redux-Saga, Stripe + more. This is going to be a full stack app (MERN stack), using Firebase.</p><p>The curriculum is going to be very hands on as we walk you from start to finish of releasing a professional React project all the way into production.&nbsp;We will start from the very beginning by teaching you React Basics and then going into advanced topics so you can make good decisions on architecture and tools on any of your future ReactJS projects. </p><p>All code is going to be provided step by step and even if you don’t like to code along, you will get access to the the full master project code so anyone signed up for the course will have their own project to put on their portfolio right away.<br><br>The topics covered will be:</p><p><strong>- React Basics</strong></p><p><strong>- React Router</strong></p><p><strong>- Redux</strong></p><p><strong>- Redux&nbsp;Saga</strong></p><p><strong>- Asynchronous Redux</strong></p><p><strong>- React Hooks</strong></p><p><strong>- Context API</strong></p><p><strong>- React Suspense + React Lazy</strong></p><p><strong>- Firebase</strong></p><p><strong>-&nbsp;Stripe API</strong></p><p><strong>- Styled-Components</strong></p><p><strong>- GraphQL</strong></p><p><strong>- Apollo</strong></p><p><strong>- PWAs</strong></p><p><strong>- React Performance</strong></p><p><strong>- React Design Patterns</strong></p><p><strong>- Testing with Jest and Snapshot testing</strong></p><p><strong>- React Best Practices</strong></p><p><strong>- Persistance + Session Storage</strong></p><p><strong>- State Normalization</strong></p><p><strong>+ more</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Wait wait… I know what you’re thinking. Why aren’t we building 10+ projects? Well, here’s the truth: Most courses teach you React and do just that. They show you how to get started, build 10 projects that are simple and easy to build in a day, and just add some CSS to make them look fancy. In real life though, you’re not building silly applications. When you apply to jobs, nobody is going to care that you built a really pretty To Do app. Employers want to see you build large apps that can scale, that have good architecture, and that can be deployed to production.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Let me tell you 3 reasons why this course is different from any other React tutorial online:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>1</strong>. You will build the biggest project you will see in any course. This type of project would take you months to implement yourself.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2.</strong> This course is taught by 2 instructors that have actually worked for some of the biggest tech firms using React in production. Yihua has been working on some of the biggest e-commerce websites that you have definitely heard of and probably have shopped at. Andrei has worked on enterprise level React applications for large IPOed tech firms in Silicon Valley as well as Toronto. By having both of them teach, you get to see different perspective and learn from 2 senior developers as if you are working at a company together.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3.</strong> We learn principles that are important beyond just what you learn as a beginner. Using the instructor's experiences you learn about design patterns, how to architect your app, organize your code, structure your folders, and how to think about performance. Let’s just say we don’t shy away from the advanced topics.</p><p><br></p><p>This course is not about making you just code along without understanding the principles so that when you are done with the course you don’t know what to do other than watch another tutorial. No! <strong>This course will push you and challenge you to go from an absolute beginner in React to someone that is in the top 10% of React developers.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Taught By:<br></strong></p><p>Andrei&nbsp;Neagoie is the instructor of the <strong>highest rated Development courses on Udemy as well as&nbsp;one of the fastest&nbsp;growing.&nbsp;</strong>His graduates have&nbsp;moved&nbsp;on to work for&nbsp;some of the biggest tech&nbsp;companies around the world like Apple, Google, Amazon, JP Morgan, IBM, UNIQLO etc...&nbsp;He&nbsp;has&nbsp;been working as a senior software developer in&nbsp;Silicon Valley and Toronto for many years,&nbsp;and&nbsp;is now taking all that he has learned,&nbsp;to teach&nbsp;programming skills and&nbsp;to help you&nbsp;discover the amazing career opportunities that being a developer allows in&nbsp;life.&nbsp;</p><p>Having been&nbsp;a self taught programmer,&nbsp;he understands that there is an&nbsp;overwhelming number of online courses, tutorials and books&nbsp;that are overly verbose and inadequate at teaching proper skills.&nbsp;Most people feel paralyzed and don't know where to start when learning a complex subject matter, or even worse, most people don't have $20,000 to spend on a coding bootcamp.&nbsp;<strong>Programming skills should be affordable and open to all. An education material&nbsp;should teach real life skills that are current and&nbsp;they should not waste a student's valuable time.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Having learned important&nbsp;lessons from working for Fortune 500 companies, tech startups, to even&nbsp;founding his own business, he is now dedicating 100% of his time to&nbsp;teaching others valuable&nbsp;software development skills&nbsp;in order to take control of their life and work in an exciting industry with infinite possibilities.&nbsp;</p><p>Andrei promises you that there are no other courses out there as comprehensive and as well explained.&nbsp;<strong>He believes that in order to learn anything of value, you need to start with the foundation and develop the roots of the tree. Only from there will you be able to learn concepts and specific skills(leaves) that connect to the foundation. Learning becomes exponential when structured in this way.</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Taking his experience in educational psychology and coding, Andrei's courses will take you on an understanding of complex subjects that you never thought would be possible.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><p><strong>See you inside the courses!<br><br><br><br>Yihua Zhang is one of the Instructors of Zero To Mastery, one of the highest rated and fastest growing Web Development academies on Udemy</strong>. He has been working as a software developer for numerous years in Toronto for some of the largest tech companies in the world. He has also been working as an instructor for more than a decade. He is focused on bringing everything he has learned to help you achieve a new career as a developer, but also give you all the fundamental skills required to flourish in this incredible industry.</p><p><br></p><p>Yihua is a self taught developer, so he fully understands the challenges and mindset of coming into this industry from various other backgrounds. He has been on both sides of the table, as both an instructor and student numerous times so he can empathize with the difficulty of learning something new and challenging. Learning itself is a skill that needs to be practiced and improved upon, and he is dedicated to helping you improve and master that skill for yourself. Courses need to be practical, you need to be able to understand why you are learning the things that you are being taught. You need to understand the problem before you know the solution, and he prides himself on teaching you how to build professional, real world applications so you truly understand why you are doing things a specific way. He will teach you the mindset and skillset required to grow as a developer as fast as possible, so you can have the rich and fulfilling life that comes with this career.</p><p><br></p><p>Yihua's courses will guide you to build beautifully written and richly featured applications, while truly understanding all the complex concepts you will encounter along the way.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",

The content is based directly on last semester of my in-person<strong> coding bootcamps</strong>, where my students go on to land <strong>6-figure developer jobs</strong>. I cover the exact same computer science content that has helped my students ace interviews at huge companies like <strong>Google, Tesla, Amazon</strong>, and <strong>Facebook</strong>. Nothing is watered down for an online audience; this is the real deal :)   We start with the basics and then eventually cover “advanced topics” that similar courses shy away from like <strong>Heaps, Graphs</strong>, and <strong>Dijkstra’s Shortest Path Algorithm</strong>. </p><p>I start by teaching you how to analyze your code’s time and space complexity using <strong>Big O notation</strong>.  We cover the ins and outs of <strong>Recursion</strong>.  We learn a 5-step approach to solving any difficult coding problem. We cover common programming patterns. We implement popular <strong>searching algorithms</strong>. We write 6 different <strong>sorting algorithms</strong>: Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Quick, Merge, and Radix Sort.   Then, we switch gears and implement our own<strong> data structures</strong> from scratch, including <strong>linked lists, trees, heaps, hash tables</strong>, and <strong>graphs</strong>.  We learn to traverse trees and graphs, and cover <strong>Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm</strong>.

Especially in web development (though not limited to that), Docker can really <strong>take you to the next level</strong>!</p><p>With Docker, you create and manage so-called \"<strong>Containers</strong>\" - basically packages of code and tools required to run that code. These containers allow you to run your programs in a<strong> predictable, environment-independent way</strong> - no matter where you need to run it.</p><p>For modern DevOps (Development Operations) but also for local development - on your own or in a team - this is a <strong>winner feature</strong> since you will no longer have any \"but it worked on my machine\"&nbsp;discussions. It works inside of a container, hence it works everywhere!</p><p><strong>This course will teach you both Docker &amp;&nbsp;Kubernetes from the ground up with all the required theory and tons of examples and demos!</strong></p><p>We'll explore <strong>all key concepts</strong> in detail and <strong>with practical examples and demos</strong> - from images and containers, over volumes and networking all the way up to deployment and Kubernetes Cluster:&nbsp;This course has it all!</p><p><strong>In detail, this course includes the following topics:</strong></p><ul><li><p>A thorough introduction to Docker, containers and why you might want to use Docker</p></li><li><p>Detailed setup instructions for macOS and Windows</p></li><li><p>A deep-dive into the core concepts you need to know:&nbsp;Containers &amp;&nbsp;images</p></li><li><p>Learn how to create custom images, use existing images and how to run containers based on such images</p></li><li><p>Get a detailed overview of the core commands you need when working with Docker</p></li><li><p>Learn how to work with data and how to persist data with volumes</p></li><li><p>Explore container networking - with the outside world and between multiple containers</p></li><li><p>Learn how to work with both single and multi-container projects</p></li><li><p>In-depth deployment instructions:&nbsp;Manual deployment and deployment with managed services like AWS&nbsp;ECS</p></li><li><p>Understand Kubernetes core concepts &amp;&nbsp;architecture</p></li><li><p>Learn how to create Kubernetes resources, deployments, services and how to run your containers with Kubernetes</p></li><li><p>Dive deeply into working with data in Kubernetes projects - with different types of volumes</p></li><li><p>Kubernetes networking and DNS service discovery</p></li><li><p>Learn how to deploy your Kubernetes project (at the example of AWS&nbsp;EKS)</p></li><li><p>And much more!</p></li></ul><p>All these topics are taught in great detail with slides and theory but also, most importantly, with many examples and demo!</p><p>You'll find tons of demo projects throughout the course - using programming languages like NodeJS, Python or PHP&nbsp;(with Laravel).

            "description": "<p><strong>Smart Contracts? </strong>They're here.  <strong>The </strong><strong>Ethereum Blockchain?  </strong>Covered.  <strong>Solidity?  </strong>Yep!</p>\n\n<p>There can be no understating it: Ethereum and Blockchain technology is the most disruptive force in years.  Companies cannot hire developers who understand blockchain technologies fast enough, but there are a tiny number of resources published to help you truly <em>understand</em> what blockchains are used for, let alone build apps with them.  That's the purpose of this course: <strong></strong>to be the <strong>best resource online</strong> for learning about Ethereum, blockchains, and how to build apps with this new technology.<strong></strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The development community is still figuring out the best way to use Ethereum in the creation of new and exciting apps.  I spent a tremendous amount of time to research and create best practice for interfacing with Ethereum from Javascript.  I can't overstate it enough; this course will show you the best and <strong>most easily repeatable patterns</strong> for creating production-ready apps with Ethereum.</p><p><br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>What tools and libraries are used?</strong></em></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The Ethereum tech ecosystem is in constant change.  Don't be fooled by other courses that mention how you'll learn a dozen different libraries!  Every library that you'll use with Ethereum breaks and is deprecated on a near-weekly basis!  Instead, this course will teach you <strong>how to assemble your own boilerplate package </strong>to develop, compile, and test Smart Contracts.  By learning the <strong>core technologies</strong>, you'll be prepared to adjust to Ethereum no matter how the ecosystem changes.<br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>What is Ethereum?</strong></em><br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Ethereum is a cryptocurrency much like Bitcoin, and it has been heralded as <strong>Bitcoins successor</strong>.  Whereas Bitcoin currently has issues scaling with an increasing backlog of transactions, Ethereum is poised to surpass Bitcoin in performance, popularity, and value.  Ethereum was created to help developers like you create applications focused around transferring money or value from one party to another.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>What is Solidity?</strong></em></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Solidity is a programming language for writing Smart Contracts.  Essentially, think of it as a way to control a bank account with code.  With Solidity, we can write applications that simulate a crowd funding campaign, a lottery, a loan, or any other type of financial instrument.  Don't be intimidated by learning 'another' programming language; Solidity is known to be quite similar to Javascript and exceptionally easy to pick up for anyone who has previous JS experience.  This course will give you all the tools you need to master Solidity.<br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><br></p>",

Would you like to become a more complete and in-demand developer?</p><p>Then Node.js is the hot technology for you to learn right now, and you came to the right place to do it!</p><p>Welcome to the Complete Node.js, Express, and MongoDB Bootcamp, your fast track to modern back-end development.</p><p><strong>This course is the perfect all-in-one package that will take you from a complete beginner to an advanced, highly-skilled Node.js developer. </strong></p><p>Like all my other courses, this one is completely project-based! And not just any project: it's a complete, beautiful, and feature-rich application, containing both a RESTful API and a server-side rendered website. It's the most fantastic and complete project that you will find in any Node.js course on the internet!</p><p><strong>By building this huge project, you will learn all the skills that you need in order to plan, build, and deploy your own modern back-end applications with Node.js and related technologies.</strong></p><p><em>(If you feel like exploring the project, you can do so at www[.]natours[.]dev. And this is only a small part of the project! Log in with \"laura@example.com\" and password \"test1234\")</em></p><p><br></p><p><strong>After finishing this course, you will:</strong></p><p><strong>1)</strong> Be building your own fast, scalable, and powerful Node.js RESTful APIs or web applications;</p><p><strong>2)</strong> Truly understand how Node.js works behind the scenes;</p><p><strong>3)</strong> Be able to work with NoSQL data and model data in real-world situations (a hugely important skill);</p><p><strong>4)</strong> Know how modern back-end development works, and how all the different technologies fit together (hard to understand from scattered tutorials and videos);</p><p><strong>5)</strong> Have experience in professionally used tools and libraries like Express, Mongoose, Stripe, Sendgrid, Atlas, Compass, Git, Heroku, and many more;</p><p><strong>6)</strong> Have built a complete application, which is a perfect starting point for your own applications in the future.</p><p>Please note that this course is <strong>NOT</strong> for absolute web development beginners, so you should already be familiar with basic JavaScript. <strong>NO</strong> back-end experience required though!</p><p><br></p><p><strong>It's an absolutely full-packed, deep-dive course with over 40 hours of content!</strong></p><p>Since this is the \"Complete Node.js Bootcamp\", the course is crammed with tons of different technologies, techniques, and tools, so that you walk away from the course as a complete Node.js developer.</p><p>That's why the course turned out to be over 40 hours long. But if that sounds like too much for you, don't worry, there are videos or entire sections that you can safely skip. </p><p>Here is exactly what you're gonna learn:</p><ul><li><p>Fundamentals of Node.js, core modules, and NPM (Node Package Manager)</p></li><li><p>How Node.js works behind the scenes: event loop, blocking vs non-blocking code, event-driven architecture, streams, modules, etc.</p></li><li><p>Fundamentals of Express (Node.js framework): routing, middleware, sending responses, etc.</p></li><li><p>RESTful API design and development with advanced features: filtering, sorting, aliasing, pagination</p></li><li><p>Server-side website rendering (HTML) with Pug templates</p></li><li><p>CRUD operations with MongoDB database locally and on the Atlas platform (in the cloud)</p></li><li><p>Advanced MongoDB: geospatial queries, aggregation pipeline, and operators</p></li><li><p>Fundamentals of Mongoose (MongoDB JS driver): Data models, CRUD operations, data validation, and middleware</p></li><li><p>Advanced Mongoose features: modeling geospatial data, populates, virtual populates, indexes, etc.</p></li><li><p>Using the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture</p></li><li><p>How to work with data in NoSQL databases</p></li><li><p>Advanced data modelling: relationships between data, embedding, referencing, and more</p></li><li><p>Complete modern authentication with JWT: user sign up, log in, password reset, secure cookies, etc.</p></li><li><p>Authorization (user roles)</p></li><li><p>Security: best practices, encryption, sanitization, rate limiting, etc.</p></li><li><p>Accepting credit card payments with Stripe: Complete integration on the back-end and front-end</p></li><li><p>Uploading files and image processing</p></li><li><p>Sending emails with Mailtrap and Sendgrid</p></li><li><p>Advanced error handling workflows</p></li><li><p>Deploying Node.js application to production with Heroku</p></li><li><p>Git and GitHub crash course</p></li><li><p>And so much more!</p></li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>Why should you learn Node.js and take this course?</strong></p><p>If you want to learn Node.js and modern back-end development, then there is no doubt that this course is for you!</p><p>It's the biggest Node.js course on the internet, it has by far the most complete course project, and offers the most in-depth explanations of all topics included.</p><p>And even if you already know some Node.js, you should still take this course, because it contains subjects that are not covered anywhere else, or not in the same depth!</p><p><em>But maybe you're not yet convinced that Node.js really is the right technology for you to learn right now?</em></p><p>Well, first, Node.js will allow you to use your JavaScript skills to build applications on the back-end. That itself is a huge gain, which makes your full-stack development process so much easier and faster. </p><p>Plus, popularity and opportunities for Node.js are off the charts. It's a modern, proven, and reliable technology, used by tech giants (and 6-figure-salary-paying companies) like Netflix, PayPal, Uber, and many more.</p><p>Node.js really is what you should invest your time in, instead of outdated technology like PHP. </p><p>In summary, if you already know JavaScript, learning Node is the logical next step for you! <strong><em>It will make you a better, more versatile, and more complete developer, which will ultimately boost your opportunities in the job market!</em></strong></p><p><em>And I created this course to help you do exactly that! It really is the course I wish I had when I was first learning back-end development with Node.js and all related technologies.</em></p><p><br></p><p><strong>And this is what you get by signing up today:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Lifetime access to 40+ hours of&nbsp;HD quality videos. No monthly subscription. Learn at your own pace, whenever you want;</p></li><li><p>Friendly and fast support in the course Q&amp;A whenever you have questions or get stuck;</p></li><li><p>English closed captions (not the auto-generated ones provided by Udemy);</p></li><li><p>Course slides in PDF format;</p></li><li><p>Downloadable assets, starter code, and final code for each section;</p></li><li><p>Lots of small challenges are included in the videos so you can track your progress.</p></li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>And now, I hope to welcome you as a new student in my course!

Students     can expect to learn the minimum needed to start using Git in less than an hour.  </p><p><strong>Recent Course Updates</strong></p><ul><li>October 17th: Added <em>Updates and Errata</em> section</li></ul>  Course Outline  <p>  \t<strong>Course Introduction and Overview</strong> provides an introduction to this course and the Git source control system. Key concepts     and the basic workflow are discussed.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong>Setup and Configuration</strong> provides step-by-step instructions on how to setup Git for Windows and Mac OS X, how to use Git's help     command, and how to setup the minimum required configuration to start using Git.  </p>  <p>  \t       In <strong>Working with Git Locally</strong>, we walk through all the commands needed to start a new project managed by Git (or enable Git for an existing project)     all the way through making commits, including common file operations like moving and deleting files. We also cover how to exclude the wrong files from accidentally     being committed and how to review your repository's history.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong>Going Remote</strong> covers publishing the locally created repository (previous section) on GitHub. Starting off by setting up SSH authentication, creating     the remote version of our repository, linking the local repository with the remote version on GitHub, and finally sending our changes up to remote repository.  </p>  Course Features  <p>  \t<strong>Presentations</strong> provide audio/video training of conceptual ideas. Since few like slide-ware presentations, slide-presentations are kept to a minimum.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong>Screencasts</strong> provide a video of the instructor's computer system with any actions, commands, or screens displayed and narrated. There is a total     of 56 minutes of video based training in this course (Presentation + Screencasts, excluding Promo Video).  </p>  <p>  \t       Following each lecture or group of related lectures in the demo sections of the course are <strong>Command Listing</strong> lectures that serve as reference and     reminder of the commands used in the previous lecture(s). Each Command Listing includes the exact listings used in the previous lectures and a reference guide     for newly introduced commands. All commands used in this course are available through the Command Listing lectures.  </p>  <p>  \t       The four <strong>Quizzes</strong> reinforce the key concepts by testing your newly learned knowledge throughout the course.  </p>  <p>  \t       Several <strong>attachments</strong> throughout the course provide supplemental information, illustrations, or other reference material.  </p>  Moving Forward  <p>  \t       Students can checkout my last lecture on other Git related resources. The instructor is available for simple questions by email and can provide customized     paid instruction upon request -- go the the author's profile for contact.</p>",

Join a live online community of 900,000+ engineers and a course taught by industry experts that have actually worked for large companies in places like Silicon Valley and Toronto.</strong> <strong>Graduates of Andrei’s courses are now working at Google, Tesla, Amazon, Apple, IBM, JP Morgan, Meta, + other top tech companies.&nbsp;You will go from zero to mastery!</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Learn Data Science and Machine Learning from scratch, get hired, and have fun along the way with the most modern, up-to-date Data Science course on Udemy (we use the latest version of Python, Tensorflow 2.0 and other libraries). This course is focused on efficiency: never spend time on confusing, out of date, incomplete Machine Learning tutorials anymore. <strong>We are pretty confident that this is the most comprehensive and modern course you will find on the subject anywhere (bold statement, we know).</strong></p><p>This comprehensive and<strong> </strong>project based course<strong> will introduce you to all of the modern skills of a Data Scientist and along the way, we will build many real world projects to add to your portfolio. </strong>You will get access to all the code, workbooks and templates (Jupyter Notebooks) on Github, so that you can put them on your portfolio right away! We believe this course solves the biggest challenge to entering the Data Science and Machine Learning field:<strong> having all the necessary resources in one place and learning the latest trends and on the job skills that employers want. </strong></p><p><br>The curriculum is going to be very hands on as we walk you from start to finish of becoming a professional Machine Learning and Data Science engineer.&nbsp;The course covers 2 tracks. If you already know programming, you can dive right in and skip the section where we teach you Python from scratch. If you are completely new, we take you from the very beginning and actually teach you Python and how to use it in the real world for our projects. Don't worry, once we go through the basics like Machine Learning 101 and Python, we then get going into advanced topics like Neural Networks, Deep Learning and Transfer Learning so you can get real life practice and be ready for the real world <strong>(We show you fully fledged Data Science and Machine Learning projects and give you programming Resources and Cheatsheets)!</strong><br><br><strong>The topics covered in this course are:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Data Exploration and Visualizations</strong></p><p><strong>- Neural Networks and Deep Learning</strong></p><p><strong>- Model Evaluation and Analysis</strong></p><p><strong>- Python 3</strong></p><p><strong>- Tensorflow 2.0</strong></p><p><strong>- Numpy</strong></p><p><strong>- Scikit-Learn</strong></p><p><strong>- Data Science and Machine Learning Projects and Workflows</strong></p><p><strong>- Data Visualization in Python with MatPlotLib and Seaborn</strong></p><p><strong>- Transfer Learning</strong></p><p><strong>- Image recognition and classification</strong></p><p><strong>- Train/Test and cross validation</strong></p><p><strong>- Supervised Learning: Classification, Regression and Time Series</strong></p><p><strong>- Decision Trees and Random Forests</strong></p><p><strong>- Ensemble Learning</strong></p><p><strong>- Hyperparameter Tuning</strong></p><p><strong>- Using Pandas&nbsp;Data Frames to solve complex tasks</strong></p><p><strong>- Use Pandas&nbsp;to handle CSV Files</strong></p><p><strong>- Deep Learning / Neural Networks with TensorFlow 2.0 and Keras</strong></p><p><strong>-&nbsp;Using Kaggle and entering Machine Learning competitions</strong></p><p><strong>- How to present your findings and impress your boss</strong></p><p><strong>- How to clean and prepare your data for analysis</strong></p><p><strong>- K Nearest Neighbours</strong></p><p><strong>- Support Vector&nbsp;Machines</strong></p><p><strong>- Regression analysis (Linear Regression/Polynomial Regression)</strong></p><p><strong>- How Hadoop, Apache Spark, Kafka, and Apache Flink are used</strong></p><p><strong>- Setting up your environment with Conda, MiniConda, and Jupyter Notebooks</strong></p><p><strong>- Using GPUs with Google Colab</strong></p><p><br></p><p>By the end of this course, you will be a complete Data Scientist that can get hired at large companies. We are going to use everything we learn in the course to <strong>build professional real world projects like Heart Disease Detection, Bulldozer Price Predictor, Dog Breed Image Classifier, and many more</strong>. By the end, you will have a stack of projects you have built that you can show off to others.</p><p><br></p><p>Here’s the truth: Most courses teach you Data&nbsp;Science and do just that. They show you how to get started. But the thing is, you don’t know where to go from there or how to build your own projects. Or they show you a lot of code and complex math on the screen, but they don't really explain things well enough for you to go off on your own and solve real life machine learning problems. </p><p><br></p><p>Whether you are new to programming, or want to level up your Data Science skills, or are coming from a different industry, this course is for you. This course is not about making you just code along without understanding the principles so that when you are done with the course you don’t know what to do other than watch another tutorial. No! <strong>This course will push you and challenge you to go from an absolute beginner with no Data Science experience, to someone that can go off, forget about Daniel and Andrei, and build their own Data Science and Machine learning workflows. </strong></p><p><br>Machine Learning has applications in Business Marketing and Finance, Healthcare, Cybersecurity, Retail, Transportation and Logistics, Agriculture, Internet of Things, Gaming and Entertainment, Patient Diagnosis, Fraud Detection, Anomaly Detection in Manufacturing, Government, Academia/Research, Recommendation Systems and so much more. The skills learned in this course are going to give you a lot of options for your career. </p><p>You hear statements like Artificial Neural Network, or Artificial Intelligence (AI), and by the end of this course, you will finally understand what these mean!</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Click “Enroll Now” and join others in our community to get a leg up in the industry, and learn Data Scientist and Machine Learning. We guarantee this is better than any bootcamp or online course out there on the topic. See you inside the course!</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Taught By:<br><br>Daniel Bourke:<br></strong>A self-taught Machine Learning Engineer who lives on the internet with an uncurable desire to take long walks and fill up blank pages.</p><p>My experience in machine learning comes from working at one of Australia's fastest-growing artificial intelligence agencies, Max Kelsen.</p><p>I've worked on machine learning and data problems across a wide range of industries including healthcare, eCommerce, finance, retail and more.</p><p>Two of my favourite projects include building a machine learning model to extract information from doctors notes for one of Australia's leading medical research facilities, as well as building a natural language model to assess insurance claims for one of Australia's largest insurance groups.</p><p>Due to the performance of the natural language model (a model which reads insurance claims and decides which party is at fault), the insurance company were able to reduce their daily assessment load by up to 2,500 claims.</p><p>My long-term goal is to combine my knowledge of machine learning and my background in nutrition to work towards answering the question \"what should I eat?\".</p><p>Aside from building machine learning models on my own, I love writing about and making videos on the process. My articles and videos on machine learning on Medium, personal blog and YouTube have collectively received over 5-million views.</p><p>I love nothing more than a complicated topic explained in an entertaining and educative matter. I know what it's like to try and learn a new topic, online and on your own. So I pour my soul into making sure my creations are accessible as possible.</p><p>My modus operandi (a fancy term for my way of doing things) is learning to create and creating to learn. If you know the Japanese word for this concept, please let me know.</p><p>Questions are always welcome.<br><br></p><p><strong>Andrei&nbsp;Neagoie:<br></strong>Andrei is the instructor of the <strong>highest rated Development courses on Udemy as well as&nbsp;one of the fastest&nbsp;growing.&nbsp;</strong>His graduates have&nbsp;moved&nbsp;on to work for&nbsp;some of the biggest tech&nbsp;companies around the world like Apple, Google, Amazon, JP Morgan, IBM, UNIQLO etc...&nbsp;He&nbsp;has&nbsp;been working as a senior software developer in&nbsp;Silicon Valley and Toronto for many years,&nbsp;and&nbsp;is now taking all that he has learned,&nbsp;to teach&nbsp;programming skills and&nbsp;to help you&nbsp;discover the amazing career opportunities that being a developer allows in&nbsp;life.&nbsp;</p><p>Having been&nbsp;a self taught programmer,&nbsp;he understands that there is an&nbsp;overwhelming number of online courses, tutorials and books&nbsp;that are overly verbose and inadequate at teaching proper skills.&nbsp;Most people feel paralyzed and don't know where to start when learning a complex subject matter, or even worse, most people don't have $20,000 to spend on a coding bootcamp.&nbsp;<strong>Programming skills should be affordable and open to all. An education material&nbsp;should teach real life skills that are current and&nbsp;they should not waste a student's valuable time.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Having learned important&nbsp;lessons from working for Fortune 500 companies, tech startups, to even&nbsp;founding his own business, he is now dedicating 100% of his time to&nbsp;teaching others valuable&nbsp;software development skills&nbsp;in order to take control of their life and work in an exciting industry with infinite possibilities.&nbsp;</p><p>Andrei promises you that there are no other courses out there as comprehensive and as well explained.&nbsp;<strong>He believes that in order to learn anything of value, you need to start with the foundation and develop the roots of the tree. Only from there will you be able to learn concepts and specific skills(leaves) that connect to the foundation. Learning becomes exponential when structured in this way.</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Taking his experience in educational psychology and coding, Andrei's courses will take you on an understanding of complex subjects that you never thought would be possible.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><p><strong>See you inside the course!</strong></p>",

Este curso é completo e para você!<br>Programador experiente em outra linguagem de programação e quer aprender Python 3? Este curso também é completo e pra você!</p><p>Mesmo que não tenha trabalhado com programação antes (ou se já é um desenvolvedor experiente), vou te guiar em todos os passos até que comece a criar seus próprios scripts, programas, sites e/ou automatizações em Python (na versão 3). Continuo atualizando constantemente este curso.</p><p>Vamos iniciar do zero, desde a instalação do Python 3 até as partes bem mais avançadas da linguagem, como módulos de terceiros, bases de dados (MySQL, SQLite, etc...), web scraping, padrões de projeto GoF (Design Patterns), expressões regulares (RegEx) e muito mais. Alguns dos módulos que abordaremos&nbsp; já são consagrados no mercado, como Django, Selenium, SQLite, Pytest, Unittest e vários outros.</p><p>Criaremos projetos reais do zero, como um gerador e validador de CPF, uma seção dedicada ao PySide6 para interfaces gráficas com projetos, sites usando Django e mais. Como nosso curso é constantemente atualizado, essa descrição não vai conter tudo o que está nas aulas (tem mais coisas lá no curso).</p><p>Também faremos deploy da nossa aplicação em um servidor com Linux no Google Cloud Platform, ou seja, você vai ter que colocar a mão na massa para subir e configurar um servidor Linux e suas chaves SSH junto comigo (claro que te guiarei em todos os passos). </p><p>Este curso está dividido da seguinte maneira:</p><ul><li><p>Para nível iniciante: Lógica de programação (partes básicas de Python 3)</p></li><li><p>Para nível intermediário: Programação procedural e funcional (funções, repetições e partes relacionadas)</p></li><li><p>Para experientes: Programação orientada a objetos (no modo Pythônico) - Inclui seção específica de POO com Padrões de Projeto GoF</p></li><li><p>Módulos úteis: inclui aulas de módulos específicos do Python e de terceiros</p></li><li><p>Bases de dados: inclui aulas relacionadas com bases de dados no Python</p></li><li><p>Django: Criaremos alguns projetos (sites) utilizando o Django.</p></li><li><p>Interface Gráfica com PySide6 (Qt 6) com Python</p></li><li><p>Testes no Python (com TDD básico)</p></li><li><p>Bônus: Expressões Regulares (Regex - re)</p></li><li><p>Design Patterns (Padrões de projeto - GoF) - Programação Orientada a Objetos Avançada</p></li><li><p>Bônus: seções de HTML5 e CSS3</p></li><li><p>Bônus:&nbsp;seção de SQL&nbsp;com MySQL</p></li></ul><p>Também vamos falar sobre interface gráfica no Python para criação de janelas, criação de sites com Django e muito mais. Além de tudo isso, temos uma seção específica onde você aprender a executar as consultas mais comuns em bases de dados SQL (MySQL). Após essa seção o aluno será capaz de criar, apagar, atualizar, ler e fazer relações entre tabelas da base de dados.</p><p>Ao terminar esse curso, você poderá conseguir sua sonhada vaga no Mercado de trabalho como dev, já que todos os nossos projetos são voltados para a prática e não apenas teoria.</p><p>Venha aprender a linguagem que mais cresce neste ano agora!</p>",
